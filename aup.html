        <ul>
          <li>
          The First Rule of Hayseed Networks is...Do nothing to attract unwanted attention 
          from cops, feds, terrorists, hackers, crackers, 31337 H4X0Rs, other sysadmins, 
          etc to Hayseed Networks or its users.</li>
          <li>
          The Second Rule of Hayseed Networks is...Do nothing to attract unwanted attention 
          from cops, feds, terrorists, hackers, crackers, 31337 H4X0Rs, other sysadmins, 
          etc to Hayseed Networks or its users.</li>
          <li>
          The Third Rule of Hayseed Networks is...If this is your first time at Hayseed
          Networks you MUST fight.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Okay, seems simple.  But we are not kidding.  The world is a dangerous place
        in general, and the beast that is the worldwide internet is a exemplary
        macrocosm.  Enough bad shit happens without sticking your fist into hornets'
        nests on purpose.</p>

        <p>
        We are scanned, probed and prodded somewhere between 10
        and 30 times a day.  We have enough to contend with without people deliberately
        coming after us.  So users may NOT participate in any act that would bring us
        to the unwanted attention of The Powers That Be.  This includes all the groups
        listed above as well as any others that jump to mind.</p>

        <p>
        What, exactly, are we on about?  We'll we'd like to think you folks are capable 
        of imagining most of the various scenarios yourself but here are some obvious
        examples of verboten activity:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>NO SPAM from our servers</li>
        <li>NO HACKING, CRACKING, SCANNING, of ANY kind from our servers</li>
        <li>NO IRC SHIT DISTURBING from our servers</li>
        <li>and obviously, NO ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES involving Hayseed Networks assets in any way. 
        If you wish to run the risk of incarceration, fine, just don't involve us.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Also Hayseed Networks' user accounts are for the person they were issued to ONLY.  Please
        do <i>not</i> share an account, even with friends and family.  We are happy to provide
        individual accounts for said folks.  No one that is not YOU should ever know your password,
        even temporarily, or be logged into any Hayseed Networks resources using your account.  Good
        password security is in your interest.  When Hayseed Networks resources get compromised the 
        compromised assets must be taken down and re-secured.  They are Necessarily unavailable for 
        during however long that process takes.  There is also a serious threat to any
        of <i>your</i> userdata on the machines given a security breach.</p>

        <p>So give a hoot, don't pollute.</p>

        <p><b>New Rule.</b></p>

        <p>
        Ok, well, this is one of those rules above that I had hoped was
        self evident.  Hayseed Network's users are <i>not</i> allowed to
        touch/alter/edit/change/hack other Hayseed Network's users data
        without their consent, ever.  This extends, <i>oddly</i>, to user
        data on other servers, in other contexts.  Frankly it sorta falls
        under the general 'no hacking' statute above, but is being
        restated here <i>exemplis gratia</i>.
        </p>
