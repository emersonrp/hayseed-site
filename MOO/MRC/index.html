The MUD Resource Collection is a list of links to many useful sources
of MUD information. The links should be of interest to both "normal"
users of MUDs, as well as to researchers studying MUDs and related
forms of computer-mediated communications. These pages are provided as
a service to the academic community.

The graphics on these pages are limited to colored dots; due to the number
of accesses these pages get, reduction of images and the size of individual
pages decreases the load on the server (and is friendly to a variety of
browsers).

The MUD Resource Collection's pages have won a large number of awards,
which one day I may add a page to display; they include one of the
very first Cool Site of the Day awards (for 10/29/94), Best of Campus
'95, Snap! Online (CNET) Best of the Web, and Top 1000 Sites on the
World-Wide Web.  It was, to my knowledge, first listed as a cool
entertainment site on 9/16/94, by the InterNIC Scout Report. I
consider this a triumph of substance over form in a day and age where
webpages are frequently high-glitz, low-content.

Thank you all for supporting the Collection!
