This is a list of papers, bibliographies, and other items of interest
to those researching MUDs. The list is quite large, and is growing rapidly.
I have made an attempt to restrict this page to only those archives
offering things which are unique; there are many other pages which are
simply lists of resources already listed here. The links here are
broken down by category.
