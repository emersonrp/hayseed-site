in Cyberspace</a>: Issues of Teaching, Acting and Directing. Stephen A.
Schrum, Editor</font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Theatre does not exist
without its audience. Rarely is the role of the audience included in the
script of a play, but this role is necessary to the performance. There
are various ways of directing this role de-pending on the concept and the
intention of the theatrical group, its director and stage designer.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">In theatre terminology,
the separation between the stage and auditorium is called the "fourth wall."
This is an invisible wall that divides the stage and the audience into
distinct parts, found, for ex-ample, in the architecture of proscenium
stages. So the term "fourth wall" also describes the feeling of distance
that the audience gets in relation to the action on the stage. The advantage
of this wall is that both the actor and the spectator know exactly what
their assigned places and roles are; they either watch or act. Particularly
in the nat-uralistic theatre at the beginning of the 20th century, this
separation of spectator and the object of observation behind the invisible
fourth wall was thought to be essential. Richard Wagner, with his idea
of the "mystic union" of a performance&#8217;s components, stressed the im-portance
of increasing the gulf between spectator and the object.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">More recent experimental
and alternative theatre presentations have shown a variety of ways of taking
the audience into considera-tion. This theatre movement, mostly independent
from existing mainstream theatre houses, is characterized by its breaking
with tra-ditional conventions, such as the notion of the fourth wall. Such
non-traditional work found its peak in the 1960s, where the "Fringe" was
established in Great Britain. The Fringe movement is described by John
Allen in his book <i>A History of the Theatre in Europe</i> as "Alter-native
to the mainstream theatre in venue, in management, in con-tent, and in
styles of performance" (294). The Fringe movement cov-ered a wide range
of works that explored new theatrical forms, and included political groups
that used the stage to articulate their ideas. Allen further suggests that,
"Perhaps the most common element in the whole movement is the determination
to create a new audience for the theatre" (294).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">These alternative
groups often followed the path of the French author and actor Antonin Artaud,
who is known for his manifesto, "The Theatre of Cruelty," first published
in 1932, and his book, <i>Thea-tre and Its Double,</i> published in 1938.
Artaud theorized that theatre loses its popularity and its communicative
ability when it attempts to be literary. He criticized theatre productions
that concentrate too much on well known, written texts and that have, as
he said, neglec-ted new forms and the thoughts of a contemporary audience.
He de-manded a search for new methods of expression, and called for a specific
language for the stage. Furthermore, he promoted the de-construction of
stage and auditorium; for Artaud, theatre should oc-cur in a common place
without partitions and divisions. Artaud nev-er really had a chance to
experiment with his ideas in a practical manner, but his texts clearly
articulate his reasons for placing the audience in the middle of the action
to establish a direct connection between actor and spectator.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Artaud&#8217;s ideas were
very important to the English director Peter Brook who, in his book, <i>The
Empty Space,</i> not only speaks about the absolute necessity of the presence
of the audience, but also about the "responsibility" of the audience. This
responsibility means that the actual performance is established only by
having both parts&#8212;specta-tors and actors&#8212;coming together.</font></font>
<br>�
</p><dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">Now the moment of performance,
when it comes, is reached through two passageways&#8212;the foyer and the stage
door. (126-127)</font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">In his texts and his
works, Brook states the necessity of actor and audience together producing
the performance. He stressed that a director can not really see his work
until it is shown in public, and the director must be conscious of this
fact during the rehearsal period.</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">The same idea was
expressed even more radically in the Soviet theatre of the early 20th century.
The Russian director Vsevolod Meyerhold, who had already caused a stir
with his overt opposition to the naturalistic theatre, said that opening
night is the actual first rehearsal. Edward Braun, in <i>Meyerhold on Theatre,</i>
quotes Meyer-hold as saying:</font></font>
<br>�
</p><dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">We produce every play on the assumption
that it will be still unfin-ished when it appears on the stage. We do this
consciously because we realize that the crucial revision of a production
is that which is made by the spectator. (256)</font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Meyerhold sees a theatre
production split up into four dimen-sions: author, director, actor and
spectator. Brought together in the "Theatre of the Straight Line," actor
and spectator can freely devel-op their creativity. Meyerhold proposed
that the four theatrical ele-ments should be placed on a straight, horizontal
line beginning with the author, who has a clear influence on the director,
who stages the author&#8217;s work. Further, the actor assimilates the creation
of the dir-ector and "reveals his soul freely to the spectator" (50), by
"intensify-ing the fundamental theatrical relationship of performer and
specta-tor" (52). Meyerhold&#8217;s "Stylized Theatre" "forces the spectator
to create instead of merely looking on" (50). Some theatre historians suggest
that this attempt to establish a fusion between actor and spectator is
the reason that Meyerhold was the first person able to stage the contemporary
Russian plays successfully. An example of his explicit use of the audience
to fulfill the stage directions of the play script can be seen in his suggestions
for staging mass theatre.</font></font>
<br>�
<dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">How many extras are needed to
satisfy [Emile] Verhaeren&#8217;s stage dir-ection [in <i>The Dawn</i> ], "The
crowd acts as a single person of multi-ple aspects"? If he answers one
hundred, we shan&#8217;t believe him; two hundred&#8212;still too few! If the stage
will not admit 20,000, then we prefer a mere seven.... But how can we surround
him with the ar-my of extras whose support is vital? He is not likely to
accept two hundred&#8212;he needs a thousand. But how is that possible?... There-fore
we shall invite the thousands of spectators who will crowd the auditorium
of the R.S.F.S.R. Theatre No. 1 to take an active part in the performance.
(172)</font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">In his works Meyerhold
showed the practicability of his theories. In addition, he also had clear
plans for the ideal architecture of a the-atre, that integrates the audience
perfectly into the production. Be-cause of a lack of money these plans
were never realized physically, but a digital version is now available
in a VRML model on the World Wide Web.</font><font size="-1">1</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Disregarding these
architectural plans, Augusto Boal pointed out in the 1960s that redesigning
traditional theatre places is not e-nough to eliminate the strict division
between stage and auditorium. In his concept of an "invisible theatre"
he states that there is no long-er the need to <i>create </i>realistic
stages, because he can simply <i>use</i> real stages. He places his performances
in public locations were the audi-ence does not even know that they are
currently participating in a theatre performance. Boal says that by doing
so he "frees the specta-tors" from their passivity (66). He explicitly
allocates to the audience an active role in the performance, without letting
them know. As in traditional theatre, his experimental performances originate
with a written text, a conflict situation, that is rehearsed by the actors.
In the play, <i>Who Is Guilty,</i> several players who have rehearsed togeth-er,
board a public train and seat themselves apart from each other. After a
few moments, they start talking to the other passengers. When they have
established a certain atmosphere, one performer recognizes another as a
colleague he has not seen for a long time. They talk amiably about their
families and jobs but soon the conver-sation turns to politics, and they
discuss the current price increases. One says that he was happy to receive
a pay raise but still everything is getting more and more expensive. He
wonders who is to blame for the continuing rise in the cost of living and
wages. The other actors, who have not been involved yet, lead the other
passengers into this discussion.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">In the second scene,
one actor states that he thinks the greengro-cers are responsible for the
steady increase in prices. It is so hard to get meat in Argentina that
one is dependent on buying vegetables, so that the greengrocers have the
power to charge any price they want. An actress contradicts him and more
and more people, actors and non-actors, become involved in the debate.
Finally the main actor leaves the train. Some of the actors remain on the
train to follow the further development of discussion.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Boal stated that the
function of his invisible theatre, a primarily political theatre, is to
provoke discussions and urge people to start thinking about certain topics.
For this purpose Boal uses these trans-formed theatrical means to get the
spectator truly involved in the play.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">It is not only the
physical inclusion of people watching a show that is responsible for such
an active participation or for catharsis. Placement of the spectator is
important, but during the performance the actor has great responsibility
concerning not just the physical but his <i>overall</i> relationship to
the audience. As stated above, the actors and the spectator together realize
the ideas of author and director. They bring the theatre performance to
life. If they are not together in the same room at the same time and do
not care for each other, the theatre performance does not exist at all.
Furthermore, the actor must make certain continuously that the tension
between himself and the spectator does not get out of control. With his
acting skill he must attract and hold the attention of the audience.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">At the same time,
the audience has the power to kill the rhythm of the play whenever it stops
being attentive. Imagine a single actor playing for only one spectator.
They are bound together for the dura-tion of the performance in one room.
The performance begins, the actor is playing and speaking his monologue.
The spectator watches him as long as the actor succeeds in keeping him
interested in the performance. At the moment when the spectator becomes
bored or stops concentrating for even a second, the performance stops exist-ing.
With an actor playing for no one, the basic requirement for a the-atre
performance&#8212;interaction between actor and spectator&#8212;is not fulfilled. However,
if both actor and spectator remain in their roles, the performance occurs
as it would have in front of thousands of people.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">An actor knows more
than a member of the audience about his role and his power in this role.
In most cases he has rehearsed his role before. So it is up to the actor
to make certain that the audience feels comfortable and knows how to behave
in its given role during the performance. An individual in the audience
is not conscious of his or her power in most of the cases. Usually the
role of the audience is regulated by their feelings on the scale between
joy and boredom. If they are bored they will stop being active in their
role as audience. On the contrary, if they are fascinated by the show they
will be even more actively involved in the process of theatre, providing
positive responses such as applause or laughter. At the same time, an actor
will notice when the spectators start to shift in their chairs because
they are not engaged by the performance.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Meyerhold once created
a list of possible reactions of the audi-ence. He wanted to measure audience
response to find the moments when two-way communication is happening. His
list, quoted in Rob-ert Leach&#8217;s book on Meyerhold, included types of reaction
such as: Silence; Noise; Loud noise; Reading in concord (i.e., following
the text as the actor spoke it); Singing; Coughing; Stamping; Fidgeting;
Exclamations; Weeping; Laughter; Sighing; Hubbub; Applause; Whistling;
Hissing; Walking out of the auditorium; Standing up; Throwing things onto
the stage (44). These actions describe the pure presence of the audience.
All of these noises and movements show the actor that someone is sitting
in the auditorium. Even without in-tentionally making noises, no presence
of a human being remains un-noticed by another human being.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">The director and actor,
while preparing the play, must consider how to encourage the activity of
the audience, so that the perfor-mance results in an actual co-production
between audience and the-atre professionals. Contrary to film or TV, theatre
is an interactive medium that demands synchronous actions. Certainly it
is not e-nough to concentrate only on the spectators&#8217; convenience or dis-pleasure
that results from the performance. As we move into the 21st century, we
are forced to work out the actual behavior of the audi-ence even more carefully,
especially when a performance is combined with the communication tool Internet.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">A play can be performed
with the use of the Internet in various ways. One could either build the
stage in a virtual room at a site on the Internet, or use the lines of
the Internet for the communication between the actors and/or between the
actors and the audience. The participants of a performance no longer necessarily
have to be at the same physical place.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">In fact, the Internet
is a perfect place for theatre, as it is becom-ing more and more an appropriate
place for communications art. Communications art began with projects in
mail art and fax art,</font><font size="-1">2</font><font size="+1"> pursued
mainly by visual artists. They began to intensify collabora-tion via communications
media by exchanging visual products until this dialog became more important
than the product itself and the works of this art became the events.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">The Canadian artist
Robert Adrian X, who now lives in Austria, says that this progress was
driven by a certain development of the galleries in the early 1980s. At
that time galleries concentrated more and more on the marketing and distribution
of the products so that soon the artists looked for a more direct way of
distributing their works of art. This attempt to escape the market place
of the galleries resulted in communications art, and visual art began to
step out of the galleries and became less object-oriented.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">One of Adrian&#8217;s most
famous projects was "The World in 24 Hours" in 1982, during the Ars Electronica
Festival in Linz, Austria. Artists in sixteen cities on three continents
were linked via SlowScan TV, Fax and voice transmission to exchange works,
improvisations and information. Such projects illustrate how a new space
for art gradually evolved. Adrian sees this exploration similar to those
of the conceptual art movement in the 1970s.</font></font>
<br>�
</p><dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">The Electronic Space in which
telecommunications artists operate&#8212;alongside trans-national corporations,
stock markets and the military&#8212;is a complex idea only made possible by
another phenomenon of art in the 1970&#8217;s...conceptual art. Conceptual art
predicts, and requires, a conceptual space in which to exist, and a culture
that has grasped that elusive notion will have no trouble at all de-materializing
its power structures into something as relative-ly concrete as the Electronic
Space of the global networks of interna-tional communications. (36)</font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Event art, communications
art and performance art have one special characteristic in common: It is
impossible to document or rec-ord such a work of art. Mail art, fax art
or other events using com-munication tools can only be caught at the time
they happen. They are ephemeral, and what remains is only a report about
the event.</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">A unique character
is also typical for any theatre-event. A play might be performed hundreds
of times, but will be different every evening, depending on how the actors
feel, on how many spectators participate and, finally, on who is watching.
If a theatrical piece uses the Internet as a stage&#8212;when a new site on the
Internet is created and the medium becomes a space itself&#8212;the stage design
becomes the interface that the audience gets on its computer screen. Those
who are acting and watching are human beings in real space. Thus, the relationship
between actor and audience has to be guaranteed as well. So, for the justification
of making theatre in this new place, somehow one has to include the audience
in the concept of stage de-sign and directing.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">It is not absolutely
necessary to build a whole new place on the Internet to perform a play.
A stage can be situated in some of the existing rooms, or online meeting
places. Performances have already taken place in the two text-based environments,
IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and MOO (Multi User Dimension Object Oriented),
in the more "colorful" surroundings of the two-dimensional chat place "Palace,"
and with the use of CU-SeeMe videoconferencing soft-ware, which includes
real time video and audio. But any existing place used was still fairly
new for most of the participants. Examina-tion of these examples shows
that there are some possibilities for how a theatrical project that includes
the Internet in its concept can deal with the role of the audience, and
that it might not always be easy for the audience members to understand
how to behave.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">One solution for this
uncertainty was found by Stuart Harris, one of the pioneers of Internet
theatre. The English actor, who now lives in California, discovered the
theatrical potential of IRC in 1993. In December of that year he made use
of Internet Relay Chat to per-form his "Hamnet," an experimental performance
of a parody on Shakespeare&#8217;s "Hamlet." For the performance, Harris created
a chat channel named #hamnet, where actors and spectators met on-line.
He then shortened Shakespeare&#8217;s text to eighty lines, and re-duced the
number of roles in Shakespeare&#8217;s script from seventeen to nine. While Harris
reduced the number of the players, he also added roles that he found to
be useful for staging in IRC: Exit, Drums, Col-ors, Prompter and Audience.</font></font>
<br>�
</p><dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">The "actors" are not the only
ones who play around, improvise, raise a textual ruckus&#8212;members of the
audience do too. Technical-ly, all that is necessary for "audience" to
be represented on screen is for one person to use the nick &lt;audience&gt;
and type "Clap, clap, clap...," as line [1] of the script calls for, and
to comment "hmm....." at the end [line 80]. (Danet, et al)</font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Harris explicitly composed
the reaction of the audience. He chose very traditional places for this
feedback: the "character" named Audience has a line at the beginning and
at the end of the play. With this inclusion he made certain that all "dimensions,"
as Meyerhold called them, were included in his performance: in addi-tion
to author, producer, director and players, Harris had an audi-ence as well.
He was conscious of the fact that nobody could predict how the performance
would be perceived by the spectators, or even if there would be any spectators
present, and to what extent his aud-ience would be accustomed to the conventions
of an IRC channel.</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Harris gained publicity
for this event in many ways, such as an announcement on USENET newsgroups
and through appearances on American National Public Radio, local television
interviews and newspaper coverage, and he tried to make this event public
and at-tractive for IRC Users. Still, one insecurity remained: the behavior
of the audience. People attending the performance because they had heard
or read about it in traditional media might not know how to act in this
place. On the other hand, there was the danger that spec-tators, especially
those who participated because of their frequent attendance in IRC chats,
would behave in a destructive manner.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Usually people on
chat channels of IRC are known for their row-dy nature, of "coming and
going" constantly and fooling around. This environment is an online meeting
place that is accessed anony-mously. To get connected one chooses a "nickname"
and thus easily creates his or her own identity. It is obvious that this
"costuming" en-courages some people to act more thoughtlessly than they
would in their real lives. This phenomenon is mainly found in newbies,
i.e., people who are participating for the first time, who might be aston-ished
by the new possibilities that suddenly open for them. It might seem to
those people as if, even if they behave in a rowdy manner, nobody can hold
them responsible for anything they do online. In the-atre terms, there
is no usher to moderate their behavior or to force them to pay attention.
The medium of online communication gener-ally tends to bring out sides
of people that are hidden in their "real" lives. It allows people to talk
about things they would never talk about. Some people may find it easier
to reveal inner thoughts but also to criticize people. In one respect,
online communication encour-ages people to be more honest; the open aspect
of the medium offers a place for people who would be too shy in real life
to articulate their thoughts. At the same time, this environment is merely
a playground for others who may be interested only in joking around and
attacking (flaming) others online.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Harris did not try
to prevent negative behavior found on IRC channels. He allowed this risk
to be included in his idea of the theatre performance in this environment.
He even wrote lines in his script similar to the language that is used
in an IRC chat. But he also was concerned about telling a part of the audience
how to behave and re-act in certain moments. This idea served as a clever
guideline to guarantee audience interaction, including at least some of
the re-sponse that is necessary for a theatre performance. However, he
did receive a genuine, positive response to his work from an audience who
had no pre-made script in front of them.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">A further example
of a theatre performance that took place in a online meeting environment,
a MOO, was<i> NetSeduction, An Inter-active Theatrical Production, </i>written
and directed by Steve Schrum. It was performed in October 1996 in ATHEMOO.</font><font size="-1">3</font><font size="+1">
The performance showed how to eliminate the gulf between actor and spectator.
An indication that Schrum had managed this task so elegantly was that one
of the audience members who had come to watch his sister per-form did not
realize that the play had already begun.</font></font>
<br>�
</p><dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">RobertW [to Beth]: "I heard there
was a play going on tonite. Seems it got cancelled though."<font size="-1">4</font></font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">For the performance of
the play, Schrum had created, i.e., pro-grammed, a special room in ATHEMOO
and named it "NetSeduc-tion":</font></font>
<br>�
<dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">NetSeduction is an Internet chat
room and meeting place. There is a bar, dance floor, mirrored ball and
disco lights.... Most importantly there are people: people to meet, to
talk with and&#8212;perhaps&#8212;to se-duce....<font size="-1">5</font></font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">He also wrote a linear
script that was given to the five "lead act-ors." The actors met online
for several rehearsals before the two ac-tual performances, to become acclimated
to their roles and learn how to improvise. Beside the five roles (dubbed
the "Players"), Schrum had also defined two additional sets of participants:</font></font>
<br>�
<dir>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">1. Lurkers: Audience members who
hang out and watch;</font>
<p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">2. Supers: Audience members who
participate in the chat room talk-ing to each other or to the Players.<font size="-1">6</font></font>
<br>�</p></dir>
</dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">The design of the performing
space, in the form of a chat room, allowed the audience the possibility
to interact with the actors during the play. People who come to an actual
chat room are not always chatting; sometimes they hang around, only watching
and "listening" to the others. These are the "Lurkers" in the performance
of<i> NetSeduction. </i>More active chatters in a true chat room interact
with and talk to others. So in Schrum&#8217;s chat room during the performance,
they took on the role of the "Supers." The performance provided a strong
interactive compo-nent. As described above, for some audience members the
play even did not look similar to what they recognized as a perfor-mance.
For them, the chat room appeared to be an ordinary chat room, not a stage.
They missed the strict division between actor and spectator. Some of the
audience members seemed to enjoy having such an active role. Others seemed
lost, not knowing what to watch, and perhaps felt a bit uncomfortable in
their role.</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">A more clear outline
or more active guidance during the per-formance might have been helpful.
Such instructions help the spectators to get "into" the performance, to
fulfill the intention of the production. Particularly when the spectators
participating are not familiar with the medium, an introduction into the
environ-ment and the play is needed before the start of the actual perfor-mance.
This could be an integral part of the show itself, and func-tion as an
extended playbill or program. In a traditional theatre, many people read
the program during the time between being seated and the rise of the curtain.
The purpose of providing a gen-eral lead-in to the performance is similar
to that of a program. Because not all people take the time to read the
program before the performance, a presentation of the instructions to the
event can be employed instead of reading the program. Particularly in the
case of using new unknown media it is helpful to have a speech or a time
reserved to present some background informa-tion on the play and the environment.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Theatrical events
using multimedia tools and the Internet serve to show a way of staging
that is different from text based performances. Recent inventive projects
demonstrated how to present a theatre production to a world-wide audience
with the transmission of video and audio data. For example, J. Matthew
Saunders from Virginia Tech (Blacksburg, VA) and Francesco Ver-dinelli
from Italy showed how to apply RealAudio and CU-SeeMe software to traditional
theatre performance. The videoconferencing software was developed originally
to commu-nicate over long distances by sending live video and audio data.
Both theatre projects, <i>The Renaissance Man</i> (March 1996)</font><font size="-1">7</font><font size="+1">
and <i>Internet e Frammenti</i> (November 1996)</font><font size="-1">8</font><font size="+1">
demonstrated ways to use this software and the medium. The audience could
watch and listen to the performances synchronously from anywhere via their
computer screens. Furthermore, Saunders included not only the possibility
of watching the moving picture of the stage via the Internet but also had
a "virtual" actress on his stage. She was connected to the stage by a video
line, and appeared on a screen upstage. In this case one could watch not
only real, but also vir-tual, actors performing.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">The audience at their
computer screens no longer had to ima-gine the action as they had in text-based
environments, but in-stead watched pictures on their screen. Contrary to
the projects mentioned above, the audience connected via the lines of the
Internet had no opportunities to react to the action on the stage. The
complex concepts of performance did not take into account any communication
from spectator to actor, which is, as we have seen, very important when
talking about the audience that is nec-essary to a theatre performance.
The Internet was created to pro-vide worldwide information and interaction.
When a play is per-formed in an online meeting place, it is not really
necessary to give the audience a more active role than one usually would
give his RL (real-life) audience, though this is an exciting point of this
new media. What matters in the end is just to give them any role, a role
similar to the one they have in real life theatre. The spectators of an
Internet-Play do not have to be more interactive, but there should be the
possibility for them to react to what is going on on the stage. The performance
has to provide the same quantity of possible reactions as there are in
a RL theatre. When speaking of net performances, the word interactive should
include not only the performer&#8217;s possible use of the audience for the content
of the play but the performer&#8217;s consciousness of the audience&#8217;s presence
and response.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">The exclusion of the
audience when using multimedia tools seemed to result from the fear that
any response would disturb the flow of the performance. This is understandable
because the feedback can soon get out of control when the audience uses
vid-eo-cameras and microphones to broadcast their movements and noises.
Such a quantity of information of sound and pictures is easy to process
in a real life playhouse. But given the current stat-us of Internet bandwidth,
this could overload the lines quickly and effect the exclusion of some
of the audience members from watch-ing. In addition to this, the fact that
many people might not have the equipment to produce a proper reaction,
reduces the number of possible audience members, should this idea be included
in the concept.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">One reason for this
uncertainty is that theatre professionals themselves at this time are not
used to being members of a cyber-audience. Because it seems so unpredictable
how the virtual aud-ience will react, it is not easy to define the role
of the audience in theatrical scripts and concepts. This audience is new
and un-known, much like the new audience that evolved as a result of the
revolution in 1917 in Russia, about which Constantin Stanislavsky stated
in his book, <i>My Life in Art:</i></font></font>
<br>�
</p><dir>
<dir><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">We were forced to teach this new
spectator how to sit quietly, not to talk, to come to the theatre at the
proper time, not to smoke, not to crack nuts. (430)</font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">In contrast to some of
his contemporaries, Stanislavsky did not know how to handle an audience
who behaved in a way that seemed unfamiliar to him. He had never seen spectators
acting unconcerned in his theatre before. The solution for him was to handle
this aud-ience in a more childlike way. That is, in the same way children
are guided at their first theatrical event, keeping them quiet and telling
them that eating popcorn out of rustling bags disturbs the concentra-tion
of the actors. In real life theatre, no one worries about someone shouting
out his opinions during a play. If not intended or included by the director,</font><font size="-1">9</font><font size="+1">
this usually would not happen during a performance. Normally the audience
is familiar with the conventions and rules in the theatre from childhood
training, and would not disturb out of pure mischief or by mistake.</font></font>
<p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Some basic rules for
an audience participating via the lines of the Internet have to be clarified
as well: a moral standard of how to behave on the Internet generally, and
guidelines on how to move and act in the environment chosen for the performance.
Additionally, special guidelines may be necessary for the audience, depending
on the concept of a performance and the software application that is used.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">The moral rules are
called "Netiquette," the "Etiquette" on the Internet, that are some basic
ideas similar to common behaviors. As mentioned above, it is easier to
flame somebody, or to criticize a cre-ative work, speech or performance
while being online, than it is in real life, so this aspect needs certain
attention. Conversely, it is not always easy to prevent such destructive
behavior. The request to tol-erate what others are doing and, even more
so, to support the pio-neering work in this new medium does not sound fundamentally
new for our society. These rules simply need to be adapted for the new
media and must be included somehow into the concept and presenta-tion for
a new audience.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">In the case of people
attending a theatrical performance in cy-berspace, some other rules than
Netiquette must be used and appear to have even more importance. To exist,
each theatre performance has to include at least one actor, a role, a spectator
and the unity of time and space of playing and watching. So it is obvious
that the con-nection between actor and spectator is absolutely necessary
for a theatre performance to occur. Roles for the human beings portraying
actor and spectator on the Internet need specific modifications for every
production, depending on the software used and on the inten-tion of the
performance concept.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">The synchronous connection
between actor and spectator en-sures the unity of space and the unity of
time. In RL theatre this con-nection is usually established by the architecture
of the playhouse that brings actor and spectator into the same room at
the same time and offers the possibility for communication. This task could
also be carried out by the lines of the Internet that bring actor and spectator
into the same room&#8212;a virtual room&#8212;simultaneously. In both cases the spectator
is able to watch the performance of the actor at the same time it is happening
and the actor should also see and hear the spectator watching him or her.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">People accessing online
performances because of their interest in theatre may be less familiar
with the environment that was chosen for the performance. Before being
taught moral rules, they have to be told how to behave in the communication
environment to find a way to express their feelings and reactions in an
appropriate way and to prevent them from staying silent. If the software
allows them to convey their reactions but they do not use this potentiality,
it would be the same as if they simply were not there or were not given
those possibilities.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Being present in cyberspace
means telling the program you are using to access the performance that
you are present so that this in-formation can be relayed to the actors
or other audience members. Telling the program implies that the program
passes that informa-tion along to the other participants. So the pure presence
is not so easy to achieve as it seems, because we are not used to being
present in virtual space yet. The way to deal with this in the new media
still has to be determined by experience. Until these behaviors are more
commonplace, a theatre production has to tell the spectator first how to
behave in the chosen software environment to make himself or herself visible.
Not until these basics are clear can the production concept call for further
elaboration and improvisation by the audi-ence members.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Spending some time
on the training of the audience results in a wider range of possibilities
during the performance. With enough trust in the facilities of his audience
one can include every effect that the environment and the software provide.
Then, no reduction will result and one can go even further and encourage
the audience to be interactive. Following the (active) presence of the
audience, there are no further limitations for the performer&#8217;s possible
use of that audience. We have seen attempts at this in the groundbreaking
ex-amples mentioned above. These attempts succeeded best when the participants
were familiar with the way to behave and could deal with what was asked
of them.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="+1">Audience brings life
to the theatre space. In the present state of the development of Internet
theatre, what we really need from the audience is their presence. We want
to make sure that the event we constitute really reaches its intended recipients.
But then the audi-ence has to have the possibility to affect the performance
as it un-folds. Undoubtedly, the various possibilities of virtual theatre
are still to be explored. Fortunately, not only the development of the
technical potentiality but also the numbers of experiments with thea-tre
in the Internet are growing day by day. Due to limitations of space, I
have omitted many skillful examples of Internet theatre and ways to deal
with the cyber-audience that have occurred. I am sure many more will follow
and with each new theatre event the nature of a cyber-audience can be understood
further.</font><font size="-1">10</font></font>

<p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="-1">1</font> </font>"<font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT">The
early seeds of &#8216;interactivity&#8217; are found in the work of Russian stage director
Vsevolod Meyerhold. By exploding the artistic convention of the frame&#8212;for
example, proscenium arches in the theatre&#8212;he made unpre-cedented dynamic
connections to his audience. This link features a virtual re-ality walk-through
of the theatre designed by Meyerhold. One of the earliest examples of architectural
&#8216;interactivity,&#8217; the theatre was never actually com-pleted." From Gertrude
Stein Repertory Theatre. "Meyerhold&#8217;s Visionary Theater," http://ibm.park.org/vrml.html

</p><p><font face="Palatino,ZapfHumnst BT"><font size="-1">2</font> Both art
fields are characterized by communicating through the form of the medium
they are using. Communicative content is often no longer mediated in a
traditional way, but in a more artistic, more visual way. Mail, for example,
does not have to use letters for writing, but sometimes the object sent
transfers the message. How this object can look contains a high range of
possibilities, from special drawn pictures to sunglasses, or even bigger
objects. In fax art, some artists sent little Christmas trees, drawn with
only the use of ASCII text, through fax machines at Christmas time.</font>

for the provocation of a loud and clear reaction of the audience is the
<i>Volksb�hne

audience might experience&#8212;besides provoking state-ments&#8212;milk spilled on
them in the auditorium. Another example was the burning of a body of a
dead pig during half of a play. The smelling of burnt flesh would have
been hard to stand for any longer period of time. Any of this could easily
motivate a spectator to leave the audience, and when he does the actors
stop playing a second and wave good bye to the people leaving<b>.</b></font>
