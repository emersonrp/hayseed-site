      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Presence is the 
      experience of being engaged by the representations of a virtual world <A 
      href="#Anchor-Lombard-49575">(Lombard 
      and Ditton 1997</A>, <A 
      href="#Anchor-Lombard-47857">Lombard 
      2000a)</A>. Most research on presence has focused on technologies that use 
      a variety of sensory inputs (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic) to create a 
      simulacrum of a real environment, a virtual reality (VR) that mimics 
      perceptions in the physical world (cf. <A

      context of text-based virtual worlds. This paper presents a brief overview 
      of theories that identify factors that promote or undermine a sense of 
      presence in text-based virtual worlds.<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>In the context 
      of text-based virtual worlds such as MUDs, MOOs, IRC, and Chats, presence 
      is usefully described as a feeling of getting lost or wrapped up in the 
      representations of the text--of being involved, absorbed, engaged, or 
      engrossed in or by them (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Lombard-47857">Lombard 
      2000a</A>). Immersion is another term that is used in the literature on 
      presence, but it seems better suited to the kind of virtual reality 
      afforded by head-mounted displays and data-gloves, in which participants 
      are surrounded by or submerged in software-generated images, than to 
      text-based virtual worlds (cf. <A 
      href="#Anchor-Schubert-3800">Schubert 
      et al 1999</A>:270, <A 
      href="#Anchor-Slater-35326">Slater 
      and Wilbur 1997</A>:604-606).<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>As Lombard 
      notes (<A 
      href="#Anchor--Ba-54639">2000b</A>), 
      analysts use different terms to describe a sense of presence. Similarly, 
      participants use different idioms in talking about their experience of it. 
      They may say that they are “caught up” in an activity, that they are 
      “there” or “here” when speaking of a virtual place, or that a virtual 
      world is “real.” However, from the context of their statements and from 
      their descriptions of the situations in which they experience presence, it 
      is evident that participants are referring to their engagement in a 
      virtual world and to what Lombard (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Lombard-47857">2000a</A>) 
      describes as an “illusion of nonmediation.”<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Different 
      theoretical frameworks are relevant in explaining experiences of presence. 
      Various analysts (e.g., <A 
      href="#Anchor-Jacobson-44867">Jacobson 
      1999</A>, <A 
      href="#Anchor-Lea-33869">Lea 
      and Spears 1995</A>, <A 
      href="#Anchor-Walther-6296">Walther 
      1992, 1996, 1997</A>) argue that individuals engaged in text-based 
      computer-mediated communication cope with absent or attenuated cues, 
      ordinarily present in face-to-face interaction, by engaging in processes 
      of "optimized self-presentation" and "overattribution" (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Walther-6296">Walther 
      1996, 1997</A>). In the former, individuals selectively construct 
      self-images, imagining how they will appear to others; in the latter, they 
      idealize others, imagining how they appear. In these processes, people 
      become invested in such presentations and idealizations. This theoretical 
      perspective recalls Stone's analysis of phone sex. She writes (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Stone-48213">1995:93-95</A>):<br>
</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The effect of 
        narrowing bandwidth [from offline, physical reality to computer-mediated 
        communication, especially text-based CMC] is to engage more of the 
        participants' interpretive faculties….Frequently in narrow-bandwidth 
        communication the interpretive faculties of one participant or another 
        are powerfully, even obsessively, engaged….In phone sex, once the 
        signifiers begin to "float" loose from their moorings in a 
        particularized physical experience, the most powerful attractor becomes 
        the client's idealized fantasy. In this circumstance narrow bandwidth 
        becomes a powerful asset, because extremely complex fantasies can be 
        generated from a small set of cues. In enacting such fantasies, 
        participants draw on a repertoire of cultural codes to construct a 
        scenario that compresses large amounts of information into a very small 
        space….client and provider mobilize erotic tension by taking advantage 
        of lack--filling in missing information with idealized 
        information.<br>
</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>According to 
      reception theorists and other analysts of reading (cf. <A 
      href="#Anchor-Barbatsis-37516">Barbatsis, 
      Fegan, and Hansen 1999</A>, <A

      1995</A>), participants become caught up in virtual worlds when they 
      exercise their imagination to fill narrative and/or descriptive gaps. 
      Moreover, the greater the opportunity to imaginatively construct a virtual 
      world, the more a sense of presence will be strengthened. This is the 
      “less is more” view of the factors that promote the involvement of 
      readers. That is, presence is enhanced when the "glory of imagined 
      description" (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Brann-44591">Brann 
      1991</A>:468; cf. <A 
      href="#Anchor-Reed-47857">Reed 
      1991:30</A>) is not undermined.<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Although 
      analysts agree about the importance of imagination in facilitating the 
      experience of presence in the context of textual representations, there 
      are different views regarding the processes that affect it. One view 
      emphasizes the “willing suspension of disbelief.” Coleridge (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Coleridge-5677">1847:1-2</A>) 
      used the phrase in his account of “exciting the sympathy” of readers of 
      poetry in which “the incidents and agents were to be, in part at least, 
      supernatural.” For him, the act of the “willing suspension of disbelief” 
      enabled readers to engage with what they otherwise knew were “shadows of 
      imagination.” (The concept of the “willing suspension of disbelief” plays 
      an important role in semiotic and sociological theorizing about the 
      construction of and engagement in various kinds of realities--see <A 
      href="#Anchor-Wiley-2821">Wiley 
      2000a and 2000b</A>.) Laurel (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Laurel-45656">1991</A>), 
      a theorist of human-computer interaction, and Ryan (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Ryan-17304">1994, 
      1999</A>), a literary theorist, draw on Coleridge in analyzing the sense 
      of presence generated in interacting with computers and in 
      computer-mediated communication. Ryan writes (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Ryan-17304">1999:89</A>):<br>
</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>This idea of 
        suspension of disbelief is the literary-theoretical equivalent of the VR 
        concept of immersion. It describes the attitude by which the reader 
        brackets out the knowledge that the fictional world is the product of 
        language, in order to imagine it as an autonomous reality populated by 
        solid objects and embodied individuals.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The 
        suspension of disbelief model suggests how individuals may become 
        engaged in textual representations, but it does not explain why such 
        engagement fails or is otherwise limited. Research in cognitive 
        psychology addresses this issue.<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Cognitive 
      psychologists offer a view of the processes underlying both engagement and 
      disengagement in the context of textual representations. Gilbert and his 
      colleagues, drawing on Spinozan rather than Cartesian perspectives, argue 
      that people initially assign a truth value to a mental representation, 
      subsequently rejecting it only if warranted by rational assessment. As 
      Gilbert, Krull, and Malone note (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Gilbert-59125">1990:601</A>; 
      cf. <A 
      href="#Anchor-Gilbert-363">Gilbert

        Spinoza…suggested that all ideas are accepted (i.e., represented in the 
        mind as true) prior to a rational analysis of their veracity, and that 
        some ideas are subsequently unaccepted (i.e., represented as false)….In 
        short, the mental representation of a proposition or idea has a truth 
        value associated with it, and by default this value is true. This 
        default value remains unaltered when the idea is subsequently assessed 
        to be true, but is changed when the idea is subsequently assessed to be 
        false.<br>
</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Gerrig (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Gerrig-23522">1993</A>; 
      cf. <A 
      href="#Anchor-Gerrig-21683">Gerrig 
      and Pillow 1998</A>), in a critique of “toggle” theories, including 
      Coleridge’s theory of the suspension of disbelief, extends the Spinozan 
      argument in analyzing people’s engagement with “narrative worlds,” 
      including the worlds represented in text-based computer-mediated 
      communication. Like Gilbert and unlike Coleridge, Gerrig argues that 
      readers are inclined to accept information as valid in the course of 
      comprehension, disbelieving it only after conscious appraisal warrants 
      otherwise. His theory assumes that people will believe what they read 
      --"persuasion by fiction is the default outcome" (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Gerrig-23522">Gerrig 
      1993:227</A>)--until they critically scrutinize such claims and reject 
      those that are, on inspection, incredible or unwarranted. In this sense, 
      Gerrig “replaces a ‘willing suspension of disbelief’ with a ‘willing 
      construction of disbelief’ (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Gerrig-23522">1993:230</A>; 
      cf. <A 
      href="#Anchor-Gerrig-21683">Gerrig 
      and Pillow 1998:1-2-103</A>). Gerrig's model implies that comparing a 
      fictional world with a factual one will undermine a sense of presence. 
      Moreover, since people’s knowledge of or beliefs about the factual world 
      will vary, different people will accept (and reject) different claims 
      about represented (or virtual) worlds.<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>As predicted by 
      the research of Gilbert, Gerrig, and others, presence is affected when 
      participants compare the textual description of what is imagined and the 
      reality it simulates. When the real (or offline) referent of a virtual 
      world is unknown, presence is enhanced (or at least not diminished by 
      reference to knowledge and/or beliefs about “real life”); when the actual 
      referent is known, presence is inhibited or undermined, especially when 
      there is a discrepancy between the image (that which is imagined) and the 
      actual world it is supposed to resemble (see <A 
      href="#Anchor--Ba-26576">Jacobson 
      2001</A>).<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>If knowing the 
      real world represented by an imaginary one decreases a sense of presence, 
      knowing participants offline, in real life, increases the sense of 
      presence. This seems to happen when participants view a virtual world not 
      as an imaginary one, but, rather, as a medium of communication. They are 
      engaged not by the textual representation of the faux world, but by 
      interacting with people they know. This pattern is consistent with the 
      observations of Towell and Towell (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Towell-63368">1997</A>; 
      see<A 
      href="http://www.brandeis.edu/pubs/Program%20Files/Qualcomm/Eudora/attach/presence.htm#Anchor-Jacobson-44867"> 
      <A 
      href="#Anchor--Ba-26576">Jacobson 
      2001</A></A>), who report a stronger sense of presence among MOO 
      participants who knew one another in real life and/or who knew one 
      another's real names than among those who did not know one another and/or 
      who used pseudonyms.<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>The effect of 
      offline knowledge of others holds when people know one another 
      <B>before</B> they interact online. The effect of meeting people or seeing 
      photographs of them after having first encountered them online appears to 
      produce a different outcome (especially when interaction is confined to 
      cyberspace), one that reinforces the argument that imagination (and 
      projection) plays a role in creating a sense of presence. This pattern is 
      consistent with findings about the role of pictures in fostering online 
      relationships. Walther and his colleagues (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Walther-7431">2001</A>) 
      found that for people who had interacted online for a long time before 
      seeing photographs of their virtual partners, the pictures were 
      disappointing and hindered the maintenance of intense and engaging 
      relationships, and when people saw photographs of their partners before 
      they began to work together online, the pictures somewhat facilitated the 
      development of such experiences. In the case of virtual partners who 
      formed impressions of one another before seeing photographs, idealized 
      images did not match reality, and the difference was 
      disappointing.<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>When a virtual 
      world is viewed as a locus of activity, Csikszentmihalyi's theory of 
      "flow" explains a sense of presence (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Csikszentmihalyi-58521">1982, 
      1988</A>; cf. <A 
      href="#Anchor-Trevino-13458">Trevino 
      and Webster 1992</A>; <A 
      href="#Anchor-Webster-36680">Webster, 
      Trevino, and Ryan 1993</A>). Conceptualized as a "flow" experience, 
      presence entails a "merging of action and awareness," during which a 
      person loses "self-consciousness" and a sense of time, focusing on "the 
      present, blocking out the past and the future" (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Csikszentmihalyi-58521">Csikszentmihalyi 
      1982:38-42</A>; cf. <A 
      href="#Anchor-Danet-53555">Danet 
      et al 1998</A>, <A 
      href="#Anchor-Fontaine-28258">Fontaine 
      1992</A>, <A 
      href="#Anchor-Novak-5185">Novak 
      et al. 2000</A>). Flow theory addresses the experiences people have when 
      participating in activities that are intrinsically rewarding and in which 
      a person's abilities and skills match the challenges she or he encounters. 
      Intrinsically rewarding activities are those in which satisfaction is 
      derived from engaging in "the activity itself, the pattern, the action, 
      the world it provides" (<A 
      href="#Anchor-Csikszentmihalyi-58521">Csikszentmihalyi 
      1982:14</A>). Although such activities provide participants a sense of 
      challenge, people have to feel they are capable of meeting challenges; 
      otherwise, an imbalance between challenges (demands) and abilities and 
      skills (resources) will produce boredom (if the resources exceed the 
      demands) or stress (if the demands exceed the resources), both of which 
      are said to undermine, rather than enhance, a sense of absorption. In 
      Csikszentmihalyi's view, activities that induce a sense of flow include 
      play, exploration, problem-solving, and those of companionship and 
      friendship--activities that commonly take place in MOO type virtual worlds 
      (see <A 
      href="#Anchor-Jacobson-44867">Jacobson 
      2001</A>).<br>
</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Theorizing 
      about presence is found within different disciplines, although the 
      convergence is largely unnoted, perhaps because practitioners tend to 
      ignore the relevance of work done outside their own fields. Although 
      theoretical frameworks in psychology and of literary studies, especially 
      those focusing on the role of imagination and on flow experiences, each 
      provides a partial understanding of the experience of presence in 
      text-based environments, considering them together may contribute to a 
      fuller and more satisfying explanation.</FONT></P></DIV>
