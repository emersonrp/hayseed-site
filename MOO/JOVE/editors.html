            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Last year I took over the editorship of JOVE and the journal was moved to another server. Due to these changes, there was a disruption in the normal processes of receiving and evaluating manuscripts for publication and in publishing accepted submissions. Consequently, no issue of the journal appeared in 2001. Now the transitional problems have been resolved, and I expect regular publication will be resumed. Although there has been a gap in the appearance of the journal, the numbering of its volumes will be maintained; thus, the current issue is Volume 6, Number 1.</font></p>
