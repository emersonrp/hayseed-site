<p>The documentation that accompanies LambdaMOO tends to be
difficult for the first time MOO user to work through. A user of
LambdaMOO has, hence, written an online MOO tutorial which can be
ported and customized to the needs of other MOOs (as with the
online tutorial on VUW). VUW, however, had specific
help-documentation needs which were met with a World Wide Web
site dedicated to training new users to gain MOO proficiency
without having to log into the MOO. The site also provided
connection instructions for students who were unsure of how to
connect to a MOO.
