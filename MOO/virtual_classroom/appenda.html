<P>A typical VUW MOO session follows.  Here, a MUD administrator conducts an

online class meeting which includes both on-campus and distance education

students.  The session is viewed from the perspective of the administrator

(referred to as &quot;You&quot;), with his commands in bold type.  An ampersand

(&amp;) preceding a user name identifies that user as a course instructor.</P>

<P>You teleport to...</P>

<P>______&lt; The Conference Hall &gt;_______________ <BR>You are at the

beginning of a very long hallway. To the north you can see that doors line the

hallway. Each door leads to a separate discussion room, one for each Module and

one for each Tutorial on the course.  These rooms serve as informal student

forums for interaction on course-related topics. West is a large archway leading

to a special room reserved for discussion of the entire course of English 210e

in general. You can also choose to go directly to any room by simply typing the

name of the topic.  Available topic-destinations are: Resume, Letter, Manual,

Online, Report, Style, Standards, Audience, Form, Usability, Graphics, and

Design.  To go to the Resume Discussion Room, for instance, type &quot;resume&quot;.</P>

<P>---Available Exits--- <BR>&lt;south&gt; to Just Inside Hagey Hall <BR>&lt;north&gt;

to Hallway -- Outside `Resume' <BR>&lt;west&gt; to English 210e General Forum</P>

<H4>go west</H4>

<P>______&lt; English 210e General Forum &gt;_______________ <BR>A large

conference room that looks like it would fit a huge amount of people. People

come here to discuss issues on the course in general. There are several bulletin

boards here students can use to make others aware of their feelings, concerns,

and opinions about the course. Discussions very specifically related to a

particular module or tutorial should be held down the hallway just east of here.</P>

<P>---Contents: Objects and People--- <BR>You see Suggestions Board [0 notes]

<P>---Available Exits--- <BR>&lt;east&gt; to Conference Hall Foyer</P>

<P>Clem says, &quot;Hi, Colin.  Can I ask a question?&quot; <BR>You say, &quot;sure,

go ahead&quot; <BR>Clem says, &quot;Well, I just am not sure what I should be

doing; I feel like <BR>I'm behind, but I don't know what I should be doing&quot;

<BR>You say, &quot;have you completed your resume and submitted it?&quot;</P>

<H4>@time</H4>

<P>Current time in Waterloo: Tue Oct  3 18:30:57 1995 </P>

<P>Cori knocks politely to see if she may enter. <BR><B>page Cori, &quot;Come

on in, I'm just meeting with Clem...&quot;</B> <BR>Cori walks into the room

from the east. <BR>You wave to Cori. <BR>You say to Cori, &quot;great to see

you!&quot; <BR>Cori waves at you. <BR>Clem says, &quot;Well, actually I've

already started, but I don't know where to find the resumes&quot; <BR>You say

to Clem, &quot;I don't think you two have met...this is Cori&quot; <BR>Cori

smiles at Clem and exclaims, &quot;hi!&quot; <BR>Cori says to Clem, &quot;pleased

ta meetcha&quot; <BR>You say, &quot;about the resumes, Clem, as I understand

it, the resumes are now posted in a better format you can access from the course

home page&quot; <BR>Clem says to Cori, &quot;Same to you.&quot; <BR>You say, &quot;though

that's something you can ask the TA's when they arrive tonight&quot; <BR>You

say to Clem, &quot;I'm checking the home page right now...I think the

description is there under assignments&quot; <BR>&amp;Peter_Goldsworthy walks

into the room from the east. <BR>&amp;Peter_Goldsworthy says, &quot;Hi there

everyone!&quot; <BR>Patrick walks into the room from the east. <BR>&amp;Peter_Goldsworthy

says, &quot;tonight we'd like to answer any questions about the course, if there

are any?&quot; <BR>Patrick says to &amp;Peter_Goldsworthy, &quot;will the

assignments be posted or updated sometime this week&quot; <BR>&amp;Peter_Goldsworthy

says, &quot;Patrick, the updates occur somewhat manually, so it may be awhile

before you see them&quot; <BR>Sandy walks into the room from the east. <BR>Sandy

waves to &amp;Peter_Goldsworthy. <BR>Sandy says, &quot;Sorry I'm late...&quot;

<BR>Patrick says to Sandy, &quot;Hiya Sandy.  The meeting just started.&quot;

<BR>Sandy says, &quot;Have the due dates been bumped back with accordance to

the lateness of assignment #1?&quot; <BR>&amp;Peter_Goldsworthy says, &quot;originally,

we planned enough space (we thought) between assignments to allow for

flexibility, but keep in mind that if we need to move assignments we will&quot;

<BR>Sandy says, &quot;In other words those of us going home for Thanksgiving

are in for a rough ride...&quot; <BR>Clem says, &quot;Especially if you watch

football ;)&quot; <BR>Sandy says, &quot;What about people who haven't formed

groups yet? (My group only got finalized earlier this evening...)&quot; <BR>Clem

says, &quot;I need one other person for my group.&quot; <BR>Clem says, &quot;How

about this, all students who need a group type @go plaza, discuss it there and

then come back?&quot; <BR>Clem teleports out. <BR>You say, &quot;That's a good

idea...I'll tell everyone.&quot;</P>

<P>A MESSAGE TO ALL USERS FROM COLIN: &quot;STUDENTS NEEDING GROUP MEMBERS,

TYPE: @go plaza&quot;</P>

<P>Patrick teleports out.</P>

<H4>@go plaza</H4>

<P>______&lt; South End of Plaza &gt;_______________ <BR>You are at the

southern end of a large, glass-enclosed hallway. It is very light and open here.

You can see the surround areas through the glass walls. The hallway continues to

the north and exits to the south .  There is a cafe to the west and you see the

scrabble viewing gallery to the east.</P>

<P>---Contents: Objects and People--- <BR>Clem and Patrick are here.</P>

to The Blue Wren Cafe </P>

<P>Clem says, &quot;well it looks like it's just us two that don't have a group

finalized.&quot; <BR>Clem says, &quot;Patrick:  do you want to be with us?&quot;

<BR>Patrick says, &quot;Clem&gt; yeah, that'd be great.&quot; <BR>Clem says, &quot;&quot;ok.

 I'll tell Erin about it.  That's her name :)&quot; <BR>Patrick says, &quot;Okay,

thanks. :-)  You have my email address, right?&quot; <BR>You sense that &amp;Paul_Beam

is looking for you in English 210e General Forum. <BR>He pages, &quot;Hello

there, Colin, world traveler, how was Atlanta?&quot; <BR>Clem says, &quot;Yeah

I think so.  Can you post it on my board in my room here so I'll have it next

time I log on please?&quot; <BR>Patrick says, &quot;sure&quot; <BR>Patrick

tears of a sheet of paper from his note pad and writes something on it. <BR>Patrick

says, &quot;So should we leave if we've formed a group?&quot; <BR>You say to

Patrick, &quot;perhaps that would be best...you can return to the general

meeting&quot;</P>

<P>Patrick teleports out.</P>
