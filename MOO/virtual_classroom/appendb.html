<P>Since VUW is a text based environment, it is possible to capture a &quot;snapshot&quot;

of the geography of VUW.  Though the following samples of the VUW geography are

static, they express some of the sense of the world in which users move and

interact.</P>

<P>______&lt; Ring Road -- Southern Intersection &gt;_______________ <BR>You're

on the main road that encircles most of the buildings on campus. You can follow

it the full length of VUW's perimeter.  Most of the Arts buildings are on the

western side of campus, while Maths, Sciences, and Engineering areprimarily on

the east. On the northern horizon the thick square Arts library looms over the

rest of campus.    Off to the side of the road is a small bus shelter with a

cardboard sign taped to it that reads: INFOTECH interview bus departs here.

Type `enter' to get to the bus shelter.</P>

<P>It's quite chilly.  The setting sun is obscured by low-hanging clouds.

There is a light breeze wafting in.</P>

<P>---Contents: Objects and People--- <BR>You see A LARGE SIGN SAYING: &quot;ENGLISH

Stop</P>

<P><B><A NAME="2)">2)  This is one of five bus stops which allow students to

navigate through VUW more quickly.  Busses carry students between campus,

student housing, and the plaza, and allow them to travel to Toronto for an

automated interview.</A></B></P>

<P>______&lt; Ring Road South Bus Stop &gt;_______________ <BR>You are

standing under typical plexiglass and steel bus stop. If you are waiting to

catch a bus, don't worry, one should be here soon. Type 'board bus' to get on

once it arrives. If you have just arrived, type 'out' to leave the bus shelter.

Type `route' to see which bus goes where; `map' shows the general VUW geography.

Students with interviews at INFOTECH should take the White Bus to Union Station.</P>

student's movements are in bold type.</A></B></P>

<P>______&lt; Ring Road South &gt;_______________ <BR>The road rests at the

bottom of a little valley here. A large hill rises to the south, and a smaller

one lines the road to the north.</P>

<P>It's quite chilly.  The setting sun is obscured by low-hanging clouds.

There is a light breeze wafting in.</P>

<P>______&lt; Hagey Hall Main Drive &gt;_______________ <BR>A large asphalt

driveway meets Ring Road here.  Tall pine trees line the drive as it curves up a

hill north-west to Hagey Hall.  The building is tall, and red, and impressive.</P>

<P>It's quite chilly.  The setting sun is obscured by low-hanging clouds.

<H4>go northwest</H4>

<P>______&lt; Hagey Hall Front Entrance &gt;_______________ <BR>A wonderful

example of architectural monumentalism looms in front of you. Hagey Hall is

constructed entirely out of dark brown bricks. Three great wooden double doors

provide the only break in the surface of the building.  The main driveway that

leads up to Hagey Hall circles around a large pine tree, providing a return

route to Ring Road.   A formal sign to the left of the doors meets you at about

eye level, off to the side of the driveway sits a small bus shelter, and to the

north the doors lead into the building.</P>

<P>It's quite chilly.  The setting sun is obscured by low-hanging clouds.

building for academic discussions.</A></B></P>

<P>______&lt; English 210e Receiving Hall &gt;_______________ <BR>A heavy

woven banner here reads ***ENGLISH 210E***. The place looks clean and brand new.

Some writing underneath the banner reads, `Please be advised that you are now in

a formal academic setting.  While using the facilities of Hagey Hall, show the

respect and seriousness you would in any classroom setting.  Discussions,

activity, and behaviour not specifically relevant to English 210e are restricted

academic pursuits, and academic discussions'. A welcoming long hallway leads

forums for interaction on course-related topics. West is a large archway leading

to a special room reserved for discussion of the entire course of English 210e

in general. You can also choose to go directly to any room by simply typing the

name of the topic.  Available topic-destinations are: Resume, Letter, Manual,

<P>______&lt; English 210e General Forum &gt;_______________ <BR>A large

conference room that looks like it would fit a huge amount of people. People

come here to discuss issues on the course in general. There are several bulletin

boards here students can use to make others aware of their feelings, concerns,

and opinions about the course. Discussions very specifically related to a

particular module or tutorial should be held down the hallway just east of here.</P>

<P>______&lt; Intersection of University Ave and Southam Street &gt;_______________

<BR>This is the main intersection in the student housing area. The area is

filled with tall old trees and different types of houses.  The entire area seems

to have once been a family neighbourhood, but now it is filled with students.

(into housing) and west (towards campus).  There's a bus stop just off to the
