in the world of MUDs and MOOs. The sites are listed in entirely
random order. If you're not on this list, but you think you
should be, please <a href="mailto:colin_moock@iceinc.com">mail
me</a> a note. I'm not personally seeking content anymore, but
I'd be happy to list your site. If you want to get started using

    <dd> LambdaMOO provides a very large and heavily stocked FTP
        site for its users and anyone interested in learning more
        about or becoming more involved with LambdaMOO. One of
        the site's primary functions is to act as a public access
        release site for the most r ecent versions of the
        LambdaMOO server and database. Those interested in
        starting a MOO of their own can obtain the source code
        they'll need at the site. Also kept at the site are the
        LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual and the LambdaMOO help
        system, both in a variety of formats (eg. TEX, text-only,
        postscript). The Programmer's Manual provides an
        exhaustive description of programming in MOO. Other items
        held at the site include: an archive of the MOO-Cows
        email discussion list, MOO clients, source codes fo r
        various MOO objects, and a collection of articles and
        papers written about MOOs. </dd>

    <dd> anonymous login </dd>
    <dd>An anonymously accessible archive of a large amount of
        MUD client software. The site provides very little
        documentation for its contents, and assumes a knowledge
        of the software it keeps. All client software at the site
        is expected to provide its own do cumentation. The vast
        majority of the clients are freeware, and can be
        downloaded and used for free. Patch levels and versions
        of software are regularly updated. The software contained
        at the site caters to all the major operating systems and
        platforms , though software for UNIX is the most
        plentiful. Both Tiny and LP style MUD clients are
        available. Most are gzipped and tarred. Getting the
        clients to work will require the appropriate
        decompression tools. More general information on client
        software c an be found at:

    <dd>Northeastern's very large MUD archive. The site holds
        everything from documentation to MUD programs to FAQs for
        a variety of different types of MUDs. There's a good
        representation of material from most aspects of the MUD
        world. The emphasis of the site is biased slightly
        towards MOO and LPMUD. A directory called
        &quot;docs&quot; holds a variety of different MUD
        informational texts, including lists of MUDs, papers
        about MUDs, and MUD manuals for several different
        servers. Users with slow Internet connections ma y want
        to use this site to download texts for reading off-line.
        Public domain MUDlibs (databases) may also be downloaded
        by those who wish to start their own MUD. The site is
        frequently updated. </dd>

<p>Users who can manage to type in the address to this site
correctly with find a large archive of MUD material. The
information is, however, unorganized. The main content consists
of a list of MUDs, MUSHes, MUSEs, MOOs, and other types of MUDs
with telnet links for those who have their telnet application set
up to run with their World Wide Web browser. There are no actual
addresses listed, only direct links. Adjacent to some of the
listings is a minimal one line entry describing the content of
the MUD, or some important feauture of it, such as running times
or user limits. Some of the links don't connect to the MUD, but
rather to the MUD's homepage. Browsers will have to keep an eye

<p>This site provides a starting point for people interested in
MUDs that are moving beyond text-only environments. The
introduction is limited to two MOOs, Jay's House MOO, and Cardiff
MOO, which are administered by Jay Carlson and Andrew Wilson,
respectiv ely (both of whom are notable in the MOO world). Very
little information is actually contained at the site. The site
functions more as a launching point from which users can find
information. Most of the information pointed to is geared towards
the more advanced user or programmer of MOOs, a type of MUD
particularly suited to communication and user expansion. Those
interested in the technical details of combining the technologies
of MOO and the World Wide Web will find some of their questions
about cod ing and server specifications answered here. A further
resource on MUD and World Wide Web intercation can be reached at

</p>

<p>Lydia describes her site as follows, &quot;This page is a list
of links to many useful sources of MUD information. There is a
particular emphasis on MUSHes, although there is plenty of
general information as well.&quot; For the general user, her page
provides one of the more thorough collections of information
about MUDs and MUD resources. At her site you'll find a section
on each of FAQs, Documentation, Papers, MUDlists, FTP Archives,
and World Wide Web Implementations of MUDs. She even has a
collection of coll ections of MUD related material. The site also
contains a large amount of beginner to advanced information on
MUSHes, the type of MUD with which she is most familiar. </p>

</p>

<p>Composed of three parts, available at the /~jds/ directory
under /mudfaq-p1.html/, /mudfaq-p2.html/ and /mudfaq-p3.html/,
this site is a World Wide Web accessible version of the common
MUD FAQ. The questions in the FAQ are often better than the
answers, but the information is solid enough to introduce the
newcomer to the world of MUDs. The document is slightly biased
towards Tiny MUDs (social environments) over gaming MUDs, but can
be used as a launch pad for understanding both. The three parts
of the FAQ are: MUDs and MUDding, Clients and Servers, and RWHO
and MUDwho. They range from a basic introduction to the concept
of MUDs to some first steps to take towards starting a new MUD. </p>

</p>

<p>The concentration here is on MOOs, specifically educational
MOOs. The site was set up as a resource for those using MOOs for
research and eductaion, and has a good list of Multi-Lingual
MOO's, as well as a resource section with good links to other
information sources of importance in the educational MOO world.
One noteable link leads to a document which recommends a variety
of teaching methods for the MOO environment. A series of
educational MOOs are listed and reviewed according to theme and
tone. The site's maintainer, Jeffrey Galin, has written a short
getting-started guide for MOO beginners. This site provides an
example of the serious business or academic possibilities for
MOOs. </p>

<p>ThwartedEfforts provides this World Wide Web accessible
version of the MOO-Cows email discussion list archives for the
MOO community. The MOO-Cows email discussion list archives are
also available at the LambdaMOO FTP site, but in an unwieldy
download-th em-before-you-read-them style. The mail list is run
primarily for wizards (ie. moo owners and administrators) who
help each other figure out and work through anything from
starting a new MOO to programming within a MOO to handling
sensitive inter-persona l situations that occassionally arise on
MOOs. This is not the place for basics, but for advanced MOO
discussions. The list archive is particularly valued by
experienced MOOers who otherwise would be asked to answer the
same questions over and over by n ew users of the email
discussion list. Experienced MOO users who subscribe to the
MOO-Cows mailing list also subscribe to the &quot;read the

<p>This is the hub of action for SenseMedia. Link from here to
all of SenseMedia's projects, from ChibaMOO - The Sprawl (a World
Wide Web based MOO), to global shopping malls. The Sprawl page
offers a &quot;no apologies for being here&quot; style World Wide
Web inte rface to the MOO of the same name. Called a
&quot;collaborative hyperarchical integrated media
environment&quot; (chime), the Sprawl challenges its users to
learn the technology, and take part in expanding the system. The
World Wide Web component of the MOO is ex perimental and changes
constantly according to the development of new technology.
Current World Wide Web features of the MOO include a room browser
of the MOO itself (including images), a browser of users, and
World Wide Web readable help texts. TELNET access to the MOO
greatly enhances the World Wide Web experience. Users of MOO may
find the World Wide Web component static without the
interactivity of a TELNET session. </p>

<p>As the name suggests, this site is full of documents about
MOOs. A list provides access to the most common (and a few
not-so-common) FAQs and manuals in the MOO world. Of particular
note is a collection of papers and articles written about MOOs.
Some o f the papers are written by actual creators of MOOs,
others by critics and academics. Many of the papers can be found
in other collections, but some are more rare. Also included are
links to other major collections of papers. The Document Library
is a common starting point for MOO researchers. Those looking for
published academic and professional considerations of MOOs will
find them here. Unfortunately, the site is headed by an enormous

</p>

<p>Fran's page is a well stocked directory of places to go in the

primarily MOO oriented, though there are a few links to other
types of MUDs. The information presented is orderly and readable
. Included are: 1) The MUD FAQ, 2) a MOO programmers information
repository with information about the LambdaMOO server, various
patches, and other MOO-related programming tidbits, such as
clients, 3) links to MUD lists, including a few direct telnet lin

</p>

<p>As the name suggests, this list is restricted to MUSHes, but
is the most complete overall list of them. The list has a
searchable index, and a colour coding system that provides
quick-glance information about each MUSH's theme. The list runs a
check on all its MUSHes to see if they are responding to
connections. MUSHes that are not working for long enough are
eventually placed in a special &quot;Defunct MUSHes&quot; list.
Each MUSH entry also contains information about the amount of
people that have connected i n the last 24 hours, as well as
links to relevant World Wide Web pages (if there are any) for
each MUSH. Amberyl's list is also one of the few MUD lists that
provides some commentary with each of the MUSHes it lists. A
description about theme, content, tone (social versus gaming),
and unique features accompanies each entry. The list is updated
about once a month. </p>

</p>

<p>A brief though relatively accurate description of the
different types of MUDs. For those unable to get a copy of Dr.
Richard Bartle's (the original creator of MUDs) exhaustive 1990
report on MUDs, this site provides a decent abbreviated version.
Each MU D type includes a link to a user-submitted list of MUDs
of the corresponding type. The list is often short, but provides
an interesting method of MUD exposure. There's also a link to the
CSUWEB version of Doran's MUD list, which lists about 200 MUDs
acc ording to their program type. In the CSUWEB version, direct
telnet links are provided to the various MUDs, but users must
have their TELNET applications configured correctly with their

</p>

<p>The basic connection tool used to enter MUDs is TELNET. While
users of MUDs often take this technology for granted, to a first
time user, it can be confusing, and not at all intuitive. In
repsonse to the confusion many users encounter when connecting to
MUDs, Nick Carbone has written a help document to getting started
with TELNET. Once it has established a connection, the TELNET
protocol to MUDs can continue to provide a confusing interface.
Nick's document explains what to expect from the TELNET inte
rface, and describes how to fix some of the odd line wrapping and
screen scrolling that TELNET can cause. Note, though, that his
document is for use only with MOOs. </p>

<p>By name alone, a MUD is often indistinguishable from any other
MUD. The difference, for instance, between Dragon Spire and
Dragon's Den or between BatMOO (actually based on the comic-strip
character) and BatMUD (nothing to do with the comic-strip, actual
ly a medieval knights scenario) is not readily apparent. However,
many MUDs have World Wide Web sites that accompany their telnet
sites. The World Wide Web sites provide information about the MUD
that could only otherwise be discovered through lengthy T ELNET
sessions. The &quot;MUD Home Page Links&quot; site contains a
collection of nearly 50 of these World Wide Web MUD sites,
organized according to the categories of game and non-game MUD.
This site offers the ability to &quot;look before you leap&quot;

<p>Compared with its competitors, this is probably the sleekest
MUD list. It has been recognized by each of WinMag, NetGuide,
Reality Com., and Glenn Davis as their Cool Site of the Day. The
sea of MUDs is made a little more manageable by a search form tha
t allows searching by keyword, title, type of MUD, or
description. The site is unique from others in that it encourages
MUD administrators to submit their MUDs (there's a form) to the
list. In doing so, the administrators can write descriptions of
their MUDs, and include appropriate World Wide Web links. The
Connector also has a section for recent listings, and for defunct

<p>One of the largest MUD lists available, Scott's MUD List
contains over 500 entries which are generally reliable, though
the sheer size of the list results in occassional inaccuracies.
Those using text-only World Wide Web browswers will appreciate a

game oriented. The site offers an advertising spot to MUD
administrators. Listings are arranged by MUD code type, and do
not include a description of the MUD, though TELNET links are

<p>Type: Usenet group <br>
Audience: MUD administrators <br>
Access: rec.games.mud.admin </p>

<p>This Usenet group is for use by the various types of
administrators (typically referred to as Admins, Arch-Wizards,
Wizards, Gods, or Royals) on the various types of MUDs. Rather
than programming issues, discussions here focus on the actual
running of a MUD. Administrators typically have two main areas of
concern: 1) the actual running of the MUD as a computer program,
and 2) administering the social side of the MUD from within.
Discussions are rarely heated, and are devoted to working through
the many problems facing MUD adminstrators, from starting a new
MUD server to handling obstinate MUD users. The group is also
used as a place for administrators to make general announcements,
such as calls for donations, or openings of new MUDs. </p>

<p><b>4) rec.games.mud.announce</b> </p>

<p>Type: Usenet group <br>
Audience: MUD administrators and users <br>
Access: rec.games.mud.announce </p>

<p>This newsgroup is moderated by Lydia Leong, who also runs the
MUD Resource Page, and Amberyl's Almost Complete List of MUSHes.
She generally keeps the group up to date within a week. As the
name suggests, this newgroup serves as a location for general a
nnouncements to the MUD community. A variety of FAQs are posted
there regularly, including George Reese's LPMUD FAQ, and the MUDs
and MUDding FAQ. Other typical documents posted on the group are
guides to who's who in the MUD world, and happenings of im

Access: rec.games.mud.diku </p>

<p>This Usenet group is among the most-posted-to of the MUD
newsgroups. DIKU MUDs are nearly always gaming MUDs, and gaming
is nearly always the topics of conversation on the DIKU Usenet
group. A very wide variety of users post to it, from the brand
new to the seasoned veteran. Some new users come here to find
help on MUD use, or to ask for references to specific types of
MUDs. Many MUD administrators use it as a forum for announcing
the events of their MUDs, such as an opening, a move, or an
explanation for a down time. The occassional spat breaks out
between MUD users over specific happenings on certain MUDs (most
commonly character assassinations), or over which type of (or
which specific) MUD is best. General questions about MUDs can be
posted here , but they won't always be met by the most friendly
answers. Specific concerns are more appropriate. There are,
however, no moderators here. Anything up to starting a money
drive for a new MUD gets posted. </p>

<p><b>6) rec.games.mud.lp</b> </p>

<p>Type: Usenet group <br>
Audience: LPMUD users <br>
Access: rec.games.mud.lp </p>

<p>This Usenet group typically caters to experienced users and
administrators of the LP style of MUD. New users would find most
of the discussions unintelligible. The group acts as a center of
activity for programming on LPMUDs, and long threads are often
devoted to solving specific individual coding problems. The
following is not an uncommon quote from a conversation: &quot;I
think Abigail is confusing the new 'virtual inheritance with
labels' with the old 'labelled inheritance' here. Dworkin
discarded label led inheritance early in DGD's development, then
added optional labelling to virtual inheritance. The syntax is
the same, but the semantics are completely different.&quot;
Occassionally, however, less technical topics and announcements
arise. New users are not discouraged from posting. </p>

<p><b>7) rec.games.mud.misc</b> </p>

<p>Type: Usenet group <br>
Audience: All MUD users <br>
Access: rec.games.mud.misc </p>

<p>This Usenet group often gets involved in long threads on
several general MUD issues. Since the this group invites posts
from users of any type of MUD, the discussions often take the
form of heated debates about which programming language is best
suited t o which types of goals, or about which programming
language has the greatest all around functionality. Occassionally
the game versus social environment is debated, as well as the
general importance of the virtual reality of MUDs. Advertisements
for new MUDs, and calls for help often get cross-posted here.
Occassionally, innovations for MUD content start here. A number
of noteable MUD users frequent this Usenet group. </p>

<p><b>8) rec.games.mud.tiny</b> </p>

<p>Type: Usenet group <br>
Audience: Non-gaming MUD users <br>
Access: rec.games.mud.tiny </p>

<p>This Usenet group is frequented by users of Tiny (typically
social) MUDs, including MUSHes, MUCKs, MUSEs and MOOs. The topics
of conversation are very broad ranging. Specific programming
issues are occassionally discussed, as well as compiling or
server concerns. However, due to the integration of user
abilities and programmer abilities on most Tiny MUDs,
conversations rarely remain in one area. New users might ask for
information on using a client, while others might pass around a
MUD joke or discuss MUD events. The group also often acts as a
help wanted board, where programmers can find MUDs on which to
program, and administrators can find users or new sites for their
MUDs. Occassionally ethical issues (such as player freedom or
oppression, and abu se of powers) arise in the form of heated
debates. </p>

        greatly decreased the lag on the MUD, and enabled up to
        200 simul taneous connections. After the shift to the
        machine in the summer of 1995, the MUD had a fairly small
        user base, and since then has been eager to grow. Recent
        improvements include a large guild system, and the
        addition of many new quests. New users of MUDs will find
        lots of support, while veterans are encouraged to work on
        the MUD itself by building new areas. Dragon's Den has a

        geography of the virtual world spans nearly half a
        million rooms. The MUD has been around for so long that
        the players actually bought the machine it runs on
        through a fund ra ising drive. It has literally hundreds
        of spells and special skills, dozens of guilds, and
        special objects and areas. Users of this MUD have the
        potential to get lost forever. Two hundred players are
        connected simultaneously on average, with little lag .
        Elaborate detail (from sunrises to thirst) adds to the
        atmosphere of the game. BatMUD is probably the most
        developed MUD, but certainly not the easiest. You might

        January 1992 at Sam Houston State University in
        Huntsville Texas. The MudLib is based on a stock LP MUD,
        using LPC for coding. Genocide is a purely player-killer
        MUD with no monsters as found in other muds. Users engage
        in &quot;wars&quot; with each other. The original intent
        of Genocide was to train MUDders to become better player
        killers on other muds, but eventually, Genocide became a
        mud in a class of it's own. Levels are attained by
        receiving kills; when level 20 is reached , players are
        promoted to the rank of &quot;regulator&quot; and receive
        a &quot;developer&quot; character, which is used to code
        and create items and areas for the game. Administrators
        maintain stringent rules regarding the quality of new and
        old game areas and code. The MU D runs on an SGI
        Challenge machine with 640 megs of RAM and four 150 MHz
        MIPS R4400 processors, running SGI's IRIX 5.3., so the

    <dd> <p>The HyperText Hotel is an attempt to render hypertext
        fiction into the MUD environment. As a pioneering effort,
        the MOO makes some interesting adaptations to interactive
        fiction, though the experimental nature of the MOO
        creates a slightly unpolished fee l. The typical MUD room
        exit system has been replaced by a &quot;follow&quot;
        command. A section of text is presented to the user, who
        then has the option to make a comment on the text, read
        others' comments on the text, or follow a series of
        links. In the more o utgoing sections of the MOO, users
        are even permitted to add to the text at each location,
        creating an ongoing collaborative fictional work.
        Occassionally, the exits become circular, which can
        provide interesting insight into the concept of
        &quot;re-reading&quot;, but can also become repetitive
        and tedious. The more exciting experiences usually take

        not necessarily about Jaques Derrida: they didn't conform
        to the theme of post-modernism, except perhaps to make
        puns. Therefore, the administrat ion created PMC2 MOO
        (open October 1995), which is directed much more
        specifically at projects and discussions centred on
        Post-Modernism. The original sponsor (Post-Modern Culture
        Magazine) underwent an editorial staff change, and
        demanded more stringent adherence to the theme from the
        users on the MOO. On PMC2, more serious discussions of
        post-modern theory are held through Usenet style online
        discussion groups. Poetry readings are held weekly. PMC2

        <p>schMOOze University opened in July, 1994. It was the
        first networked virtual reality designed for students and
        teachers of English as a Second Language (ESL) or English
        as a Foreign Language (EFL). Julie Falsetti, a teacher of
        English as a second language had been MUDding from almost
        day one, and sought to expand her teaching into the MUD
        environment, but found that English MUDs were too
        difficult to use for non-native speakers of English. Her
        experience lead her to start schMOOze Univeris ty, which
        is used as a place for users to chat and hold classes in
        a &quot;friendly, supportive environment&quot;. All
        communciation takes place in real time. Among the
        adaptations of English teaching to MOO are language
        games, an authorable grammar maze, classroo m facilities,
        USENET feed, gopher access, and an online dictionary.
        Currently schMOOze University is home to 300 permanent
        players from over 30 countries. </p>
