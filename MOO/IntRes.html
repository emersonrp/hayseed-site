 </p><p>
	A networked virtual environment, a type of virtual reality most  
commonly known as a "MUD" or a "MOO," was used at an internationally-attended  
scientific conference held on the Internet.  Interviews with conference  
attendees indicated enthusiasm for the effectiveness of the medium, and  
revealed how the virtual environment can be modified to improve  
conferencing efficacy.  Such alterations included novel input-output  
control management; automation of conference registration;  control of  
anonymous or guest connections;  simplification of conference center  
topography;  an improved methodology for recording discussion sessions; use  
of moderated rooms to compensate for network lag; and providing buffers to  
update late arriving participants.  It is concluded that networked virtual  
environments provide an inexpensive means for effective international  
conferencing on the Internet.

<a name="INTRODUCTION"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a>
</p><p> 
 
 
Traveling to conferences and meetings is expensive and time-consuming.  Recent  
advances in Internet technology have included the development of multi-media  
virtual realities which provide real-time communication in a programmable  
object-oriented environment.  These virtual realities, referred to here as  
networked virtual environments (NVE's), are also known as MUD's (Multi-User  
Dimension/Dungeon).  Although primarily used for games,  the potential of  
NVE's as a serious communication medium is beginning to be recognized.  An NVE  
was used at an internationally-attended scientific conference held on the  
Internet.  Interviews with the users helped identify common difficulties  
encountered while using the NVE as a conferencing tool.  This manuscript  
describes the NVE, the interview results, how the NVE was improved in response  
to these results, and further studies planned to improve the NVE as an  
effective Internet conferencing medium. 
</p><p> 
<a name="NETWORKED VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS"><b>Networked Virtual Environments</b></a> 
 </p><p>
A Networked Virtual Environment (NVE), is a server that provides information  
to clients about a database that it also maintains.  The database contains  
information about a collection of objects that can be characterized as rooms,  
things and other connected persons.  The information in the NVE database is  
organized in such a manner that the person using the client is presented with  
a virtual representation of a real room in which there could be other people  
with whom one may "talk."  Talking in this context means using the keyboard to  
communicate with the other person(s) who share the same room with you;  
likewise, "hearing" means to see the NVE output.  Typically NVE's are  
compartmentalized into rooms joined by entrances and exits.  Hence, there is a  
topography which can be navigated with simple commands such as: "go south."   
When people move from one room to another they lose the communication they had  
with the person(s) in the previous room and can hear and talk only with those  
that are in the new room.  Hence, the NVE is  a type of virtual reality which  
is aptly suited for use as a conferencing tool in any internet, such as a  
university or corporation, or the Internet.
</p><p> 
     A recent survey of business schools indicated less than 5% considered  
"networked virtual environments (MUD's)" as  very important topics <a href="#TOWELL1">(E. R.  
Towell, in press)</a>.  Indeed, NVE's have been criticized because of their  
prominent use by college students for recreational activities <a href="#EVARD">(Evard, 1994)</a>.   
However, this criticism shows blindness toward the medium's capabilities  
<a href="#THORNLEY">(Thornley, 1994)</a> and the potential of NVE's as a serious communication medium  
is gaining recognition.  The National Institutes of Standards and Technology  
have expressed their interest in NVE's as a communication tool in the  
manufacturing industry .<a href="#note3">3</a>  A systems administration group in the College of  
Computer Science at Northeastern University found that using an NVE for multi- 
user real-time interactions provided, in many instances,  much better  
communication than electronic mail  <a href="#EVARD">(Evard, 1994)</a>.  An NVE was accepted by the  
scientific review committee at the first Electronic Computational Chemistry  
Conference as a serious medium for conferencing <a href="#TOWELL2">(J. F. Towell, in press)</a>.
</p><p> 
     Although many types of NVE's are available, this manuscript reports  
observations made using a MOO, an acronym for Multi-user dimension Object  
Oriented.  In addition to the communication and navigation capabilities  
discussed previously, a MOO is extensible.  Specific commands enable the user  
to create their own rooms and objects in such a manner that the environment  
becomes a medium of self-expression.  Thus, the server supports multiple  
connections from Internet clients, provides database information, and modifies  
the database in response to user commands <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/towell/fig1.gif">(Figure 1</a>).
</p><p> 
     For additional background information about MOO's, the reader is referred  
to the MOO Programming manual, Pavel Curtis's exposition <a href="#CURTIS">(1992) </a>and other MOO- 
related documents, such as a mailing list which focuses on maintaining MOO's  
and the MOO language.  The MOO server and standard database, which continues  
to be developed and supported by Pavel Curtis, and the information mentioned  
above are all available at the Xerox PARC Internet site.<a href="#NOTE1">1</a>  Also, an extensive  
source of MOO-related documents and writings can be found on the World Wide  
Web.<a href="#note2">2</a> 
 </p><p>
<a name="THE VIRTUAL CONFERENCE CENTER"><b>The Virtual Conference Center</b></a> 
</p><p> 
The observations presented here were made at the first Electronic Computational  
Chemistry Conference organized by Steven Bachrach and colleagues at Northern  
Illinois University, November 7-18, 1994 <a href="#KRIEGER">(Krieger and Illman, 1994</a>; <a href="#BACHRACH">Bachrach</a>,  
in press; <a href="#HARDY">Hardy</a>, in press). This conference was conducted on the World Wide Web 
with discussion of presented papers occurring via an electronic mailing 
list.  To explore the use of NVE's in scientific conferencing, an NVE was 
created as the prominent feature of a paper submitted to the conference<a href="#TOWELL2"> (J. F. 
Towell, in press)</a>.  This NVE was prepared by the administrators of BioMOO, an 
NVE for professionals in the biological sciences, which has been recognized for 
its internationally-attended scientific seminars <a href="#ANDERSON">(Anderson, 1994)</a>.  The NVE 
submitted to the conference was named the Virtual Conference Center (VCC).  Our 
paper, entitled "Networked Virtual Environments and Electronic Conferencing," 
consisted of the following information which was accessible via the World Wide 
Web.  The first part contained instructions for connecting to the VCC; the 
second part briefly discussed computational aspects of a networked virtual 
environment; and the third part contained information about the authors.  Of the 
294 conference registrants, 99 (34%) eventually registered to gain access to the 
VCC.  During the meetings, extensive conferencing took place within the VCC.  
Recordings of those discussions were submitted to the mailing list so that all 
conference attendees could read and comment on the content of the discussions. 
The following discussion is the result of the conference attendees' reactions 
obtained either by interview within the VCC or electronically mailed comments.  
This paper discusses the problems associated with the use of an NVE, such as the 
VCC, at an Internet conference.
</p><p>	 
	In the following discussion, words in bold type indicate commands that  
would be entered from the user's keyboard.  For example, if the user were to  
issue a command to say, "hi,"  the reader will observe the command in bold type  
like this: say hi.  It is assumed the user would type the command and then  
strike the enter key of the keyboard.   
 </p><p>
<a name="CONNECTING TO A NETWORKED VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT"><b>Connecting to a Networked Virtual Environment</b></a> 
 </p><p>
The most generally available method for connecting to an NVE is with the use 
of telnet.  However, this type of connection is generally accompanied by a 
surprising and confusing event.  While entering a command or statement, 
output from the NVE disrupts the same line the user was trying to type.  
Observing one's entry disappear is baffling which compounds the confusion 
which usually exists from initial exposure to a virtual environment.  
Experienced users employ clients programmed specifically for interacting 
with NVE's. These clients separate NVE output from the user's input.  
Clients are available on the Internet by ftp, but some users do not have the 
skills or the time to acquire and install these programs on their own 
systems.  To solve this problem VCC registrants were given instructions for 
connecting to an Internet site that automatically provided a client for 
connection to the VCC.  Providing this client proved to be an effective 
means for bringing inexperienced users into an NVE.
</p><p> 
	The client, tinyfugue, was preset to the /visual on mode which presents  
to the user a screen divided by a horizontal line about three fourths of the 
way down the page.   Output from the NVE is displayed in the top part of the 
screen while input from the user is displayed in the lower portion.  Some  
participants complained of screen disruptions which were corrected when they 
entered: /visual off.  Turning to /visual off mode no longer divides the 
screen into output/input panels but does preserve the user's entries when 
output from the NVE is displayed.  Normally users type: @quit to break their 
connection to an NVE and then: /quit to discontinue the client.  The client 
was programmed to quit following the @quit command which alleviated the 
problem of people being able to disconnect from the VCC but not knowing how 
to quit from the client.
</p><p> 
	We have programmed the VCC to provide telnet-connected users with a  
method that allows them to enter their statements without interruptions  
from the room.  This novel method is called the Output Control Manager. 
</p><p> 
<a name="OUTPUT CONTROL MANAGER"><b>Output Control Manager</b></a> 
 </p><p>
To understand the following discussion it is necessary to introduce the 
commands for making statements within the VCC (and most NVE's).  Assume the 
user's name is Beth.  To make declarative statements, Beth would type: say 
<text>, where <text> would be the statement.  For example, to say hello, 
Beth would type: say hello.  All people in the same room as Beth would 
observe: Beth says, "hello." - except for Beth who would observe: You say, 
"hello."  Note that say can be substituted with " (double quotation mark).  
Hence, to say hello, Beth could also type: "hello.  A second frequently used 
command for communicating actions or emotions is the emote command.  If Beth 
wanted to smile she would type: emote smiles and others in the same room 
(including Beth) would see: Beth smiles.  As with say, emote can also be 
issued with an abbreviated command which is  : (the colon).
</text></text></p><p>  
	The output control manager is activated when users enter the say (") or 
emote (:) command without any text following.   They are then shielded from 
VCC output until their statement has been entered at which time they are 
given a playback of any statements that had occurred while they were in the 
input mode.  This feature has been received with great enthusiasm by many 
NVE managers who have adopted the code.<a href="#note4">4</a>  
 </p><p>
<a name="VCC REGISTRATION"><b>VCC Registration</b></a> 
</p><p>
There was some frustration with the VCC registration procedure because of 
several complicating factors associated with creating and debugging the VCC. 
 Although these problems would not have occurred if the bugs had been 
discovered earlier, it nevertheless prompted us to consider better ways to 
conduct registration.
</p><p> 
	There are two standard registration procedures.  In the first, requests  
are sent by NVE-connected users which contains their choice of a user 
identification name (userID) and their Internet address.  The server checks 
the userID for database redundancy and returns to the user the approved 
userID along with a password via electronic mail.    In the second, an 
administrator of the NVE performs the process manually.  The former is 
undesirable because the user often selects a userID that provides 
insufficient user identification.  Likewise, the latter requires excessive 
time.  Having a suitable identification is important because recordings were 
made of the discussions.  When users talk in an NVE, their name precedes 
their statement.  For example, if Pavel_Curtis says, "Hi, I'm new here," 
everyone in the same room plus readers of the recording transcript will see: 
Pavel_Curtis says, "Hi, I'm new here."  Hence it is important that an 
informative userID is assigned to the person.  If one plans to use an NVE as 
part of an electronic conference, we suggest pre-registering the 
participants and sending them an e-mail message containing their userIDs and 
passwords for the VCC.  Pre-registration was not done in the conference 
reported here because the VCC was not part of the conference organizational 
structure.  Automatically issuing userID's is advantageous because the 
userID can be set to the conference registrant's real name and thus provide 
adequate identification of the participant within the VCC.  Also, with 
regard to correct identification in the VCC, the @rename command should be 
deactivated to prevent a particular user from assuming another identity.
</p><p>   
	The VCC database requires a server that can utilize external files.  
Normally information stored in the standard MOO database is kept in memory 
but the VCC keeps much of it's information on disk to be loaded when needed. 
 This external file utilization requires the use of the File Utilities 
Package (FUP) developed at the Weizmann Institute of Science by Gustavo 
Glusman and Jaime Prilusky.<a href="#note5">5</a>  During registration for an Internet-based 
conference, registrant information can be written to an external file which 
in turn can be read by the VCC and used to create a character with an 
appropriate userID. 
</p><p> 
<a name="GUESTS"><b>Guests</b></a> 
 </p><p>
Generally most NVE's permit a type of connection which does not demand a 
userID or password.  Such anonymous connections are called guest connections 
and they may be problematic.  The VCC was configured to permit guest 
connections for several days preceding the commencement of the meetings.  
This provided an opportunity for new users to come into the environment and 
explore it anonymously.  However, once the meetings commenced, guest 
connections were shunted into a room which instructed them on registration 
procedures and barred them from the VCC discussion rooms.
</p><p> 
	It has been suggested that guests be given more opportunity to explore  
the VCC anonymously after the meetings have started.  The VCC has been altered 
by extending the guest room area to include rooms for running tutorials on 
using the VCC.  Another suggestion was to allow guests to hear the 
discussion taking place in various conference rooms without participating in 
them.  Guests could be provided with a radio-like device with channels for  
selecting among the various discussion sessions currently underway.  By 
experiencing the interactive discussions, guests might eventually want to 
come into the VCC as participants.  Allowing guests to take tutorials and 
hear conference discussions will be studied at the upcoming conference 
discussed in the discussion section of this paper. 
 </p><p>
<a name="VIRTUAL CONFERENCE CENTER TOPOGRAPHY"><b>Virtual Conference Center Topography</b></a> 
 </p><p>
The topography of the VCC was intended to be as simple and straightforward 
as possible.  The VCC can be configured so that it brings a newly connected 
user into any room.  The VCC starting point was a central room called the 
PLAZA (<a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/towell/fig2.gif">Figure 2</a>).  The PLAZA was used for posting scheduling information 
and, as in real conferences, contained bulletin boards which could be used 
for a variety of messages such as employment opportunities and personal 
messages.  From the PLAZA, the user needed to issue only one command to 
enter any of ten rooms, eight of which  were named according to their 
direction from the PLAZA (the COFFEE SHOP was down from the PLAZA and the 
UPPER ROOM was up from the PLAZA).  For example, to attend a meeting in the 
NORTH ROOM, users entered: north or n following their connection and arrival 
in the PLAZA.  Each of the conference rooms, except for the PLAZA, had only 
one entrance and one exit.  Thus, to go to the PLAZA from any of the 
conference rooms, one merely had to type: out or exit.
</p><p>
<a name="RECORDING DISCUSSIONS"><b>Recording Discussions</b></a> 
</p><p> 
The VCC contained recorders in each of the rooms, except the PLAZA, and 
recorded discussions were kept and archived.  The recorders were stopped and 
reloaded daily.  Recordings from the previous day were then edited and sent 
to the conference mailing list for all to read.  Some conference 
participants had difficulty reading the transcripts from recorded 
discussions.  One common problem was discomfort with personal comments 
intertwined with serious discussion.
</p><p> 
	The interactive aspects of NVE's provide a surprisingly natural social 
environment, and humans, being playful creatures, often behave as such.  
This playfulness was generally reflected in the recordings of discussion 
sessions even though the topic of discussion was serious and of a highly 
technical nature.  Part of the playfulness is derived from the discovery of 
the new and stimulating NVE environment.  Even those who were present at the 
discussion and thought the personal comments were not distracting at the 
time felt that reading the transcript afterwards was difficult.   The 
interlaced personal comments seemed  mere distractions later on.  Hence, 
this phenomenon seems appropriately described as, "You had to be there to 
appreciate it."
</p><p> 
	How can we capture only the serious part of the discussion for the 
transcripts?  This problem may be solved in several ways.  First, the VCC 
has commands that permit interpersonal communication which is not captured 
by the recorders.  These methods can be used effectively for side comments 
and are used extensively by the more experienced NVE user.  As discussed 
previously, the say command may be issued with a double quotation mark (").  
We have modified this by designating two double quotation marks ("") and 
emotes (:) when preceding text to be recognized by the recorder as an 
off-the-record statement.  The recorder responds accordingly by placing a 
pound sign (#) at the beginning of the statement.  Hence, when a transcript 
is generated from the recording, off-the-record statements can be excluded 
from the transcript.  Thus, the smiles, gestures, jokes and other personal 
comments are kept as part of the moment but not formal history.  A 
description in each of the conference rooms informs the users that 
statements that are not intended for the record should be preceded with two 
double quotation marks and that communications made via the emote command 
will also be excluded from the record. Other changes have also been made to 
filter messages generated by the server from the transcript of the 
discussions.  For example, if someone in the room disconnects, an 
announcement is made to everyone in the room, including the recorder.  The 
VCC has been modified to place the pound sign in front of any general 
announcements made by the server during discussions.  The results of the 
modifications to the recording and transcript-generating procedures will 
also be tested at the upcoming Electronic Glycosiences Conference discussed 
later in this paper. 
</p><p> 
<a name="INTERNET LAG AND MODERATED ROOMS"><b>Internet Lag and Moderated Rooms</b></a> 
 </p><p>
A second common problem with reading transcripts involved statements that 
seemed out of place or were not in the flow of the conversation.  The 
appearance of disjointed comments can be due to many factors.  Depending on 
the time of day, Internet lag can physically prevent a person's statements 
from appearing on the screen in the temporal order of a natural 
conversation.  Internet lag is defined here as simply a delay of signals 
sent between the client and server due to communication delays on the 
Internet.  Delays can also be due to the server, but that was not the cause 
of the lagging reported here.  Hence, when such delayed signals are 
received, they are not synchronized with the rest of the discussion and 
appear disjointed.  During the conference, the European participants talked 
of considerable transatlantic lag that worsened towards their afternoon.  
What can be done to accommodate those who are having difficulty with 
Internet lag?
</p><p> 
	Experienced NVE users typically announce when they are experiencing lag  
so others in the conversation will understand and compensate by waiting for  
the lagger's responses.  Inexperienced users will probably have difficulty 
adopting this compensatory mechanism, and the VCC itself can be used to 
help.  During seminars at BioMOO and discussion sessions at the VCC, we have 
experimented with the use of a moderated room.<a href="#note6">6</a>  This room permits 
communication only after the user has entered: request.  Following the 
request command, users are placed in a queue and must wait for their turn to 
talk.  Current speakers have the floor for their discussion until they are 
finished at which time they enter the command: yield.  Then the next person 
in the queue is allowed to talk.  The number of people who are permitted to 
talk is adjustable.  A moderator can monitor the queue to see who is waiting 
to talk and can encourage users to yield or, if necessary, force them to 
yield.  With the use of the moderated room, the discussion was focused, and 
those with lag problems, once they gained the floor, could make their 
comments in the natural flow of the conversation.  More experimentation is 
needed with this technique, but there were no complaints from VCC users 
about adjusting to the request and yield commands in the moderated room. 
 </p><p>
<a name="SCHEDULING INTERNATONAL CONFERENCES"><b>Scheduling International Conferences</b></a> 
 </p><p>
One major problem with holding internationally-attended conferences is  
deciding when to have them.  The time-zone distribution of the presenters  
at the conference (<a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/towell/fig3.gif">Figure 3</a>) indicates that a meeting scheduled at 8:00  
Pacific Standard Time (PST), which is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) minus 8 hours,  
would occur between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm for most of the people who were  
presenters at the meetings.  However, Internet lag was most prevalent for the  
Europeans at 8:00 pm PST which was also a time outside of normal working hours  
for those located in Australia, Hawaii, and Hong Kong.  One group of conference 
attendees decided to resolve these problems by scheduling two conference 
times, the first at 08:00 GMT, the second at 23:00 GMT.  The transcript from 
the morning session was sent to the mailing list so those attending the 
later conference could discuss the topics from the earlier session.  Having 
two conference sessions worked very well and should be considered as a 
useful alternative to scheduling only one session when most attendees are in 
their normal workday.  It also revealed the importance of the interplay 
between the VCC real-time conferencing and the communication via the mailing 
list.  There is no need to have one without the other, each has distinct 
advantages. 
</p><p> 
<a name="USERS VERSUS BUILDERS"><b>Users Versus Builders</b></a> 
 </p><p>
When a person is connected to the VCC, the object that represents that 
person in the virtual sense is referred to as a player-object.  There is a 
hierarchical classification of player-objects that progressively allow 
greater control of the NVE environment.  A "player"  can only connect to the 
NVE, navigate it, talk with other users and manipulate the objects there.  A 
"builder" has all the capabilities of the "player" and the additional 
ability to create new objects such as rooms and things that can be placed in 
the room.  The VCC registrants were automatically given "builder" status  
and many of the scientists, with the use of the extensive help system, 
quickly learned how to use the create commands.  Soon the VCC was littered 
with lamps, sofas, cappuchino machines, liquor bottles, etc.  While the 
ability to make objects is undoubtedly a fascinating property of the VCC for 
many people, the result was the creation of distractions for others who 
desired only to discuss science and not pass around wine bottles.  Thus, 
while it is difficult to sanction restriction of personal freedom in the 
VCC, it is perhaps best if conference attendees are given "player" status to 
minimize potential problems with differing personal opinions of a proper VCC 
environment.

<a name="STAGE TALK"><b>Stage Talk</b></a> 
</p><p> 
Stage talk is the term used to direct a comment or question to a particular 
person in the same room.  For example, if Franz were in the same room with 
John, and John typed: to Franz What do you mean?, all present in the room 
would see on their screens: John[to Franz]: What do you mean?  Stage talk is 
a useful tool when involved in multi-person discussions.  However, the VCC 
did not explain how to use this feature in its help messages nor were 
instructions provided in the preliminary instructions sent to VCC 
registrants when they first registered.  The conferees were quick to learn 
it when they were with someone else who was using it but we suggest 
including this feature and appropriate instructions in any NVE to be used 
for conferencing.  The VCC now provides use of the command to which permits 
a combined ability for stage talk while protected by the output control 
manager discussed earlier.

<a name="BUFFERS"><b>Buffers</b></a> 
</p><p> 
As can be expected at any conference, people arriving late would often ask 
to be updated about the current topic of discussion.  Usually one or more of 
the conferees would attempt to explain the current discussion to the 
late-comer which was disruptive, wasteful and inefficient.  Hence, the VCC 
rooms have been modified to contain buffers that can update a tardy attendee 
with a replay of recent conversation in the room.  The buffer was set to 
replay the last 50 lines of the conversation.  Each room description, which 
is shown to users when they enter, contains instructions for using the 
replay buffer.  However, this information should also be sent to  users upon 
 registration.  Further work is planned to determine how many lines of 
recent conversation are necessary to update a late-arriving participant.

<a name="DISCUSSION"><b>Discussion</b></a> 
</p><p> 
This discussion has centered on the experience gained during the 
presentation of the Virtual Conference Center(VCC) at the first Electronic 
Computational Chemistry Conference in 1994.  No formal scheduling was 
attempted by the VCC presenters.  All VCC discussion sessions were either 
spontaneous or organized by conference registrants.  Undoubtedly, greater 
participation would have occurred if the VCC had been part of the conference 
organization and prior planning and scheduling could have  been 
accomplished.  The first  Electronic Computational Chemistry Conference was 
an experiment in the use of the World Wide Web as a conferencing tool.  The 
conference organizers had decided on the use of electronic mail as the means 
to discuss the papers.  We think each medium has distinct advantages and the 
use of one does not preclude the use of the other.<a href="#note7">7</a>  With the use of 
recorders in the VCC, transcripts were made which were sent to the 
conference mailing list.  Hence, all conference registrants shared the 
discussions of those that occurred in real-time in the VCC.  The first 
Electronic Glycoscience Conference to be held from September 18 to October 
13, 1995 at Oxford University will include, as part of the conference, the 
VCC.  The integration of the VCC into this conference will provide an 
excellent opportunity to test those VCC changes that have been discussed 
here, and identify new aspects of the NVE that can improve Internet 
conferencing efficacy.

<a name="CONCLUSION"><b>Conclusion</b></a> 
</p><p> 
Networked virtual environments (NVE's) are a type of virtual reality that 
are aptly suited for real-time conferences and seminars on the Internet.  We 
have studied the use of  a particular type of NVE, called a MOO, by 
scientists attending an international conference held on the Internet.  
Real-time interviews and electronically mailed comments indicated that the 
NVE was enthusiastically received.  Criticism from the scientists helped 
identify many aspects of the NVE that can be modified to improve 
conferencing efficacy.  The following are areas of concern when using an NVE 
for an internationally-attended Internet conference:   providing 
input-output control management; automation of conference registration;  
control of anonymous or guest connections;  simplification of NVE 
topography;  methodology for recording discussion sessions, use of moderated 
rooms to compensate for network lag; and providing buffers to update late 
participants.  NVE's catalyze the excitement and synergism that results when 
people communicate in real-time and hence provide an inexpensive means for 
effective international conferencing on the Internet.
