                              <a name="ABSTRACT"><b>ABSTRACT</b></a>
 <p>

A text-based networked virtual environment represents to a user a
system of rooms  joined by exits and entrances.  When navigating this
system of rooms, a user can  communicate in real time with other
connected users occupying the same room.   Hence, these virtual
environments are aptly suited for networked conferencing and  teaching.
 Anecdotal information suggested that some people feel a sense of
"being there" or presence when connected to one of these environments.
To  determine how many people feel this sense of presence, we surveyed
207 people  from 6 different groups of users of text-based networked
virtual environments.   The results indicated that 69% of these
subjects felt a sense of presence.   Experiments with people in
text-based networked virtual environments may be  helpful in
understanding the contribution to presence by social interaction in
other virtual environments.

<a name="INTRODUCTION"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a>
<p>

   It has been suggested that degree of presence in a communication medium
is related to two factors, vividness of the environment and
interactivity, the degree to which users may influence the form or
content of the mediated environment (Steuer, 1992).  Vividness of the
environment is a crucial factor in immersive environments where
communication involves a variety of sensory stimuli.  Interactivity
includes such things as social presence, or the degree to which the
environment contains other people who are reacting to you (Heeter,
1992).  Our experiences (Towell, Hansen, Mercer, Leach, Rubin,
Prilusky, &amp; Glusman., 1995; Towell &amp; Towell, 1995; Hardy, Robinson,
Doughty, Findsen, Towell, Towell, &amp; Wilson, 1996), those of Schiano
(1997), and other anecdotal expositions suggest that many people feel a
sense of presence when experiencing the primarily social environments
of text-based networked virtual environments (TNVEs), which are also
commonly referred to as MUDs (multi-user dungeons/dimensions).
However, we are unaware of any objective attempts to measure how many
people experience this sense of presence.  To assess the potential of
TNVEs as a medium for studying the interactive or social aspects of
presence, we have studied six different groups of TNVE users.  This
manuscript reports survey results from 207 TNVE users and indicates
that a sense of presence was reported by 69% of those connected to
these virtual environments.
<p>
<a name="METHODS"><b>METHODS</b></a>

 <p>

2.1  Text-Based Networked Virtual Environments
 <p>
     Emergence of the Internet has facilitated the use of TNVEs as
conferencing tools (Anderson, 1994; Evard, 1993; Towell, Hansen,
Mercer, Leach, Rubin, Prilusky, &amp; Glusman, 1995; Towell &amp; Towell, 1995;
Hardy, Robinson, Doughty, Findsen, Towell, Towell, &amp; Wilson, 1996).  A
TNVE consists of a server that provides information to clients about a
database that it also maintains.  The database contains information
about a collection of objects that can be characterized as rooms,
things and other connected persons.  The information in the TNVE
database is organized in such a manner that the person using the client
is presented with a textual representation of a room in which there
could be other people with whom he or she may "talk."  Talking in this
context means using the keyboard to communicate with the other
person(s) who share the same room with you; likewise, "hearing" means
to see textual communication on a monitor.  Typically, TNVEs are
compartmentalized into rooms joined by entrances and exits.  Hence,
there is a topography which can be navigated with simple commands such
as: "go south."  When people move from one room to another they lose
the communication they had with the person(s) in the previous room and
can "hear" and "talk" only with those in the new room.  This
presentation of a virtual space to the TNVE user has been referred to
as "imposing a spatial metaphor."(Evard, 1993).  In addition to the
communication and navigation properties, a TNVE is extensible and
dynamic.  Specific commands enable users to create their own rooms and
objects in such a manner that the environment becomes a medium of
self-expression.  The objects respond to commands from the users (or
other objects) and hence provide a dynamic environment that interacts
with its inhabitants.  Examples of these interactive objects are
recording machines, blackboards, and slide projectors.  The type of
TNVE that was used in the studies reported here is referred to as a MOO
(Curtis, 1992)  which stands for Multi-user dimension Object Oriented.
MOO not only indicates the type of TNVE but also the programming
language used to extend the virtual space from within it.
 <p>



2.2  Groups
 <p>
     The subjects were from six different groups of TNVE users.  Group I (N
=  53) consisted of scientists who had recently attended an
Internet-based scientific conference (Hardy, Robinson, Doughty,
Findsen, Towell, Towell, &amp;  Wilson, 1996).  This conference utilized a
TNVE (Towell &amp; Towell, 1995) for  scheduled real-time discussions of
papers that were concurrently available via  the World Wide Web.  Over
a four week period, 80 people used the TNVE  to  participate in
discussion sessions.  While connected to the TNVE, each person was
identified by their real name and only other scientists registered for
the  conference were present.  Groups II (N = 16) and III (N = 18)
consisted of  students at Northern Illinois University who had
participated in a one hour  laboratory exercise which consisted of a
brief introductory lecture followed by a  "hands-on" experience in a
TNVE.  Only students with no previous TNVE experience  responded to a
survey which was sent via e-mail following the laboratory  exercise.
All students connected to the TNVE were identified by their real names
and they shared the virtual space with no one other than their
classmates and the  instructor.  Groups IV (N = 40), V (N = 40), and VI
(N = 40), consisted of  subjects registered at an Internet-accessible
public TNVE, called LambdaMOO.   Groups IV-VI were sampled because they
represented people who were motivated to  use the medium for reasons
other than those in Group I, the scientists who were  using it for
scientific discussions, or those in Groups II and III, the students
who were required to use it.  Group IV consisted of subjects selected
randomly  from a list of all the people who were connected to the TNVE
during the sampling  period.  Groups V and VI consisted of subjects who
were also selected from those  currently connected but who had not been
registered for longer than a week.  The real identities of the users
from Groups IV, V, and VI were unknown.
 <p>
2.3  Instruments
 <p>
     As discussed in Methods, Groups I-VI had experienced a TNVE that
was of the  MOO type.  Hence, being connected to such an TNVE was
referred to as being  "connected to a MOO."  Instrument I consisted of
the following question:
 <p>
Please indicate the strength of your agreement with the statement below
where a "1" indicates you strongly agree and a "5" indicates you
strongly disagree.
 <p>
I feel a sense of actually being in the same room with others when I am
connected to a MOO.
 <p>
<pre>
	_____1.  strongly agree
	_____2.  moderately agree
	_____3.  neither agree or disagree
	_____4.  moderately disagree
	_____5.  strongly disagree
</pre>
<p>
Instrument II was designed to pose the same question to the user but in
a  manner whereby the subject would have to disagree with the statement
to yield the  same results as Instrument I.  Hence, Instrument II was
identical to Instrument I  except for the statement which read:
<p>
<pre>
      I *do not* feel a sense of actually being in the same room with
      others when I am connected to a MOO.
</pre>
<p>
The purpose of Instrument II was to investigate potential bias resulting
from a tendency to agree with positive assertions.
<p>
Sampling
<p>
Subjects in Groups IV, V, and VI were queried by direct communication
while  they were connected to the TNVE.  They were sent a message which
stated:
<p>
<pre>
      Could I trouble you to answer one survey-type question about MOO's?
</pre>
<p>
     If they responded affirmatively, they were sent either Instrument
I (Groups  IV &amp; VI) or Instrument II (Group V) in a manner such that it
appeared on their  screen.  Over 97% of the responses were subsequently
returned via a similar  messaging technique.  Subjects in Group I were
e-mailed the survey question  (Instrument I) at the conclusion of the
scientific conference; all subjects  responded to the survey via
e-mail.  Similarly, subjects in Groups II and III  responded to
Instrument I, which was e-mailed, or Instrument II, which was
presented directly to them,respectively, following their TNVE
experience.  Only  subjects who had not been in a TNVE prior to the
class were asked to respond to  the survey.
<p>
2.5  Analysis
<p>
     A nonparametric analysis (median test) of the ordinal data (Table
I) was  performed to test the hypothesis that data from Groups I-VI had
identical  distributions of ratings.  For this analysis the data from
the groups receiving  Instrument II was altered to represent its mirror
image.  Hence, in Groups III  and V, all 5's were converted to 1's and
all 4's were converted to 2's.  The six  sample groups were combined
into a single distribution and the grand median, Md,  for the sample
was obtained.  Thus, if the above hypothesis was true, then it  could
be assumed that any bias due to the positive assertion of the survey
statement in Instrument I could not be considered significant in this
study.
<p>
<a name="RESULTS"><b>RESULTS</b></a>
<p>
     In the following discussion the term "agreement" will be used to
indicate  either a result of 1 (strongly agree)  or 2 (moderately
agree) in groups  receiving Instrument I, or 5 (strongly disagree) or 4
(moderately disagree) in  groups receiving Instrument II.  The
responses for all the groups are shown in  Table I along with that
percentage of the group that indicated "agreement."  The  responses
from Group I (scientists) indicated "agreement" in 74% (the percentage
of those answering with either '1' or '2') of the subjects.  Of the 53
who  responded, 36 included comments and 44% of these comments (16)
made some  reference to the distress caused by Internet lag which
hindered the conference.   Group I was the only group with more '1'
(strongly agree) responses than  '2'(moderately agree).  Group II
(students) indicated "agreement" in 88% of the  subjects but 86% of
these responses were of the '2' rating.  The responses from  Group IV
indicated that 60% answered with either a '1' or a '2' but, as in
Groups  II &amp; VI, most (79%) were at the '2' level.  Responses from
Groups III and V  (marked with asterisks in Table 1) which were
administered Instrument II,  indicated that the reversal of the
Instrument I statement resulted in reversal of  the ratings and
indicated "agreement" in 56% and 58% of the subjects,  respectively.
Several comments from Groups IV, V, &amp; VI indicated that the  feeling of
presence was not static but dependent on whom they were with.
<p>
     Analysis of the data in Table I indicated an Md of 1.75 and when each
rating was compared to the value of Md a chi-squared = 8.53 resulted.
Thus, the  distributions from Groups I-VI were indistinguishable and
hence the results were  combined and depicted in the form of a
histogram (Figure 1).
<p>

<a name="DISCUSSION"><b>DISCUSSION</b></a>
<p>

     Before considering the implications of the studies reported here,
it is  necessary to briefly discuss the terminology of presence.
Steuer (1992) has  defined presence "...as the sense of being in an
environment."  Telepresence was  then defined "...as the experience of
presence in an environment by means of a  communication medium."  Thus,
the sense of presence reported here by subjects  connected to TNVEs
could be referred to as "telepresence" according to Steuer  (1992).
Sheridan (1992) intended "telepresence" to apply to environments
involving teleoperation and "virtual presence" as "...feeling like you
are  present in the environment generated by the computer."  Thus,
according to  Sheridan (1992), the sense of presence reported here may
be referred to as  "virtual presence."  To avoid this terminological
conundrum, we refer to the  feelings of "being there" experienced by
the subjects studied here as simply  presence in a TNVE.  Also, TNVEs
have been referred to as a type of virtual  reality (Curtis, 1992).
With the use of Steuer's (1992) definition of virtual  reality, which
is defined as "a real or simulated environment in which a  perceiver
experiences telepresence," it would be proper to refer to a TNVE as a
type of virtual reality.  In partial agreement with Ellis (1996) who
considers  the term virtual reality an "oxymoronic buzzword," we avoid
its use here.   However, we believe the term text-based virtual reality
may be more readily  comprehended (as opposed to text-based networked
virtual environment) by a lay  audience.
<p>
     The instruments used in the studies reported here were intended to
assess  the degree to which the subjects felt presence in the TNVEs.
It is important to  consider the shortcomings which may have resulted
from the way the instrument was  worded.  In the statement: "I feel a
sense of actually being in the same room  with others when I am
connected to a MOO,"  the inclusion of "with others" in the  question
may have biased the subject towards the social aspects of the
environment.  Hence, one must consider the possibility that the
instruments were  assessing the feelings of "being with" instead of
"being there."  However, as  noted in the introduction, interactive
features and social presence may be  contributory to presence and in
this sense one may be justified in characterizing  our results as
having tested for feelings of presence.  Nevertheless, it leaves
unanswered the question of whether there is presence contributed by
interaction  with objects in the virtual environment and/or by the
spatial metaphor of the  TNVEs.
<p>
     Recent studies have focused on the complexities of measuring presence
in  virtual environments.  Many excellent expositions on presence are
intended for  immersive environments (Held and Durlach, 1992; Slater &amp;
Usoh, 1993; Slater, Usoh  and Steed, 1994; Schloerb, 1995; Sheridan,
1996; Ellis, 1996) and are not  relevant to TNVEs.  This is because the
focus is on perception of and interaction  with the environment
primarily through sensory experience and not on textual  communication
with other objects, including humans, within the environment.   An
example of this is found in Robinett's (1992) proposal of a taxonomy
for the  classification of technologically mediated experience which
excluded verbal descriptions.
<p>

     As introduced earlier, social presence refers to the degree to
which the  environment contains other people who are reacting to you
(Heeter, 1992).  Of the  207 subjects surveyed in the studies reported
here, no one commented on the  spatial metaphor of the TNVEs as
contributory to presence.  This is puzzling in  that it has been shown
that readers of narrative scenes of spatial environments  construct a
spatial mental model that "consists of extensions of the three model
axes, and they associate objects to it." (Franklin, Tversky &amp; Coon,
1992).  One  might hypothesize that this construction of spatial mental
models would be  contributory to feelings of presence.  Some subjects
indicated that the sense of  presence was dependent on whom they were
with in the virtual environment and, for  the scientists, their
interests and involvement in the topic of discussion.   Social presence
and interactivity are most likely related to the "dramatic  presence"
discussed by Kelso et al (1993) in their studies of interactive drama.
 People who interact with a virtual world inhabited by "dynamic and
complex  characters" are referred to as "interactors."  An interactor
who isn't required  to keep to a script is called "highly interactive."
 In the TNVEs studied here,  the subjects may be likened to the Kelso
et al (1993) "interactors" wherein all  are "highly interactive" by
virtue of the absence of any scripts.  Interactivity  and its
relationship to presence is also discussed in Fontaine's studies of the
 heightened absorption experienced by people in intercultural or
international  encounters (Fontaine, 1992).  He considers the concept
of "flow" as "...a state  of consciousness occurring when we are
challenged by tasks in which equilibrium  exists between our high skill
and the task's high difficulty."  This "flow" is  suggested as a source
of "immediacy" of presence and is perhaps related to the  sense of
presence in  TNVEs, particularly in the Group I (scientists) whose
discussion sessions were intense, complex and energetic.
<p>
<a name="CONCLUSION"><b> CONCLUSION</b></a>
<p>

     The purpose of this study was to objectively assess how many
people in  TNVEs feel some degree of "being there" or presence.  Out of
207 subjects from  six different groups, 69% indicated that they
experienced a sense of presence in   TNVEs.  This presence may be
relevant to studies of presence in immersive  environments particularly
in the area of social interaction within virtual  environments.
Further experimentation is needed to determine the relative
contributory effects of social interaction, the spatial metaphor, and
other  factors (i.e.., psychological profile of the user), on the
degree of presence  experienced in TNVEs.
