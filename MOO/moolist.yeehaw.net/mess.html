<P><B>Greetings!</B> On Sunday, <B>9November97</B>, I redid the layout for
these pages. My list is now in three parts (<STRIKE>MOO Listings
A-G</STRIKE> - <A HREF="listH-O.html">MOO Listings H-O</A> - <A
HREF="listP-Z.html">MOO Listings P-Z</A>). I hope this makes it easier for
people to find their way to what they are looking for. I have plans for
other <B>major changes</B> so please stop back soon. Recently, I have been
asked many times why I have this list. This list, along with <A
HREF="moo.html">my MOO essay</A> were my first HTML projects. I now <A
HREF="http://www.reinyday.com/rday.html">get paid to do web design</A> and
I hold this initial project very near and dear to my heart. Also, <A
HREF="../onweb.html">people link to me from all over the web</A> and I
enjoy providing this service. Happy MOOing!</P>

<P>On Saturday, <B>15November97</B>, I started creating lists by category.  
Please check out my list of <A HREF="social.html">Social MOOs</A>. I also
have a list of <A HREF="misc.html">Miscellaneous MOOs</A>, which are MOOs
that don't fit into the categories of <FONT
COLOR="Green">educational</FONT>, ESL, <FONT
COLOR="Green">research</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#800080">RPG</FONT>, <FONT
COLOR="#800080">sci-fi</FONT>, or <font color="Red">social</font> (MOOs
listed as other).</P>

<P><B>19January98</B>: As of mid-January, we are back online. We were gone
for almost a month, as the server was upgraded. Sorry for the
inconvinience.</P>

<P><B>29January98</B>: This site is now being mirrored at
<STRIKE>http://aliceweb.ingenia.com/rachel/list.html</STRIKE></P>

<P><B>8February98</B>: I just completed my <A HREF="edu.html">Educational
MOOs</A> list.</P>

<P>Wednesday, <B>16September98</B>: The aliceweb mirror no longer exists
but I do have a mirror at <STRIKE>http://moolist.yeehaw.com/</STRIKE>. I
am making an effort to keep this list very up to date, as it was for its
first few years of life. Thanks to everyone who has sent additions and
corrections!

<P>Sunday, <B>6June99</B>: After finally managing to get myself graduated
from college, I am on an updating flury. I just made a new category page:
<B><A HREF="esl.html">Foreign Language (ESL) MOOs</A></B>. Enjoy!

<P>Sunday, <B>28 November 99</B>: The mirror for this site has moved from
moolist.yeehaw.com to <A HREF="http://moolist.yeehaw.net/" TARGET="top"
>moolist.yeehaw.net</A>
