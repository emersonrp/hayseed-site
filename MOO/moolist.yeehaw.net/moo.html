<p><FONT SIZE=5><A name="Paper"><b>The Purpose of MOOs</b><BR></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=4>Technology has had a profound impact on human lifestyle time 
and time again.  Since the advent of personal computers, lifestyle, in 
the United States of America especially, has undergone another dramatic 
change.  Today we live in a society where America Online has over 7 
million members and "cyberspace" is looking for its role in our day-to-day 
realities.  One of the newest  internet-related technologies is the MOO 
(MUD Object Oriented).  MOOs evolved from MUDs (Multi-User Domains).  The <A 
HREF="http://loon.music.mcgill.ca/html/Help/Help_Work.html#basic">VFF 
(Virtual FilmFestival) Help</A> web page <A 
HREF="http://www.virtualfilm.com/html/Help/Help_Work.html#history">Some MOO 
History</A> describes the beginning of MUDs and their evolution into 
MOOs:</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In the beginning, there were text-based video games. You 
put your floppy disc in and it said "You're standing in a field of green 
grass. You can go left. You can go right. You see a book on the ground."</P>
<P>After a short while, some adventurous programmers decided to put 
these games on a machine that a number of people could have access to, 
either by connecting on-site or by telnet (i.e. connecting to that 
machine via modem from their own machine). Thus, a number of people could 
be standing in that field with you, and as you decided whether or not to 
take the book, someone else could take it first, and run away. You could 
then 'go left' to catch them. Voila: interactive gaming in a virtual space.</p>
<P>These types of programs (which were used mostly for games) were 
called MUDs, which stands for Multi-User Domain, and they became very 
popular with sometimes hundreds of players connected to the same game all 
at the same time.</p>
<P>One of the things that made MUDs so popular was the fact that they 
were not static, but dynamic. The user (or gamer) could actually build 
new parts of it, new "rooms". If you didn't like the field you were 
standing in, you could build your own, and write the description, 
determine who could come in and out, create your own objects, your 
virtual home. People set up their own areas, and most MUDs grew at 
phenomenal rates.</p>
<P>At some point, the programmers changed a number of things in the 
code, and they were no longer MUDs but MOOs, (Multi-Object-Oriented, 
Multi-User Domains) but the plain ol' user didn't really notice a 
difference. Same old, same old.</p></blockquote>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>So now that MOOs are here to stay, and thousands of people 
are accessing them every day, we must ask ourselves what these virtual 
spaces are good for.  What is the purpose of MOOs?</P>

<p>When asked what the purpose of MOOs is, one student replied, 
"Mousse?  It keeps your hair stiff."  But all joking aside, let's look at 
what a MOO really is.</p>

<P>A MOO is a virtual space on the internet, as described above.  
The <A  HREF="http://www.missouri.edu/~moo/">Mizzou MOO</A> web page 
describes MOOs:</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>MOOs (MUD Object Oriented or, to some, Multiuse Object 
Oriented systems) are text-based virtual realities housed on computers 
connected to the internet.  The first of these was developed at the 
famous <A HREF="http://www.parc.xerox.com/">Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research 
Center)</A> by Pavel Curtis (aka Haakon, aka Lambda), and is known as <A 
HREF="list.html#Lambda">LambdaMOO</A>. Since the public domain release of 
the MOO server code and its subsequent porting to various operating 
systems, MOOs have become a vastly popular form of communication and 
learning. They serve a variety of functions, both social and educational, 
and are not simply games (although certainly people do play games of one 
sort or another on MOOs, often involving skill or intellectual 
challenge). Some people use them to work on their programming skills - 
the MOO server code has a built in programming language for developing 
objects and verbs (commands) in the virtual reality interface and making 
them interactive and interesting. The language is a combination of C and 
LISP, but it is its own language altogether in some respects.  <a 
href="http://www.missouri.edu/~moo/MOOProg/">The MOO Programmer's 
Manual</a>, written by Pavel Curtis, is the official guide 
to this language.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>So a MOO is a place, not a physical place, but a virtual 
place created on the network of networks that we call the internet.  The 
MOO is housed on a computer, called a server, and is accessed through a 
text relaying <A
HREF="http://www.microserve.com/~server/mudclients.html">client program</A>, 
such as <A
HREF="http://mudhole.ehche.ac.uk/~addicted/telnet-now/">telnet</A>, using a 
modem.  MOOs are written in a language that is a cross between C++ and 
LISP, called MOOCode.  MOOCode is a form of OOP (Object Oriented 
Programming).  Users of MOOs can get what is called a Programming Bit 
(basically a level of access to the core computer) that allows them to 
program in MOOCode.  Most MOOs have information about this by typing 
'help programming'.</p>

<P>Recently, some MOOs have expanded or moved to the Web.  This allows 
people to access the MOO through their Web server, rather than through a 
program such as <A 
HREF="http://mudhole.ehche.ac.uk/~addicted/telnet-now/">telnet</A>.  Why 
do this?  Well, remember that MOOs are entirely text-based.  By moving a 
MOO to the Webyou can incorporate graphics and sound.  Also, you would be 
able to access the MOO from your Web server (what you are  using now to 
access this) rather than a program like <A
HREF="http://mudhole.ehche.ac.uk/~addicted/telnet-now/">telnet</A>.  There 
are three basic ways of joining MOOs and the Web.  There is (1) MOO to Web, 
which is connecting to the Web from a MOO.  The flip side is (2) Web to 
MOO, which is using the MOO to serve information on the Web.  However, 
the most promising is (3) the WOO (Web-MOO), which uses a Web client to 
access a MOO and allows the use of HTML and HTTP to include multimedia 
(sound and graphics) aspects to the MOO experience.  (This information 
comes from <a 
href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/mud/moo-www/directory.html">MOO-WWW</a>.)  
Various problems have arisen in implementing this new WOO technology.  
One of the problems is a Web server's lack of continuous  connection, 
as opposed to telnet.  The <A 
HREF="http://loon.music.mcgill.ca/html/Help/Help_Work.html#basic">VFF 
(Virtual FilmFestival) Help</A> web page <A 
HREF="http://www.virtualfilm.com/html/Help/Help_Work.html#history">Some 
MOO History</A> describes this problem:</p></FONT>

<blockquote>A WebMOO is the latest incarnation of a whole bunch o' 
exciting technological inventions over the last 15 years . . .people 
started to put their MOOs on the Web, with varying levels of success.  
One of the main problems stems from the basic fact that a Web connection 
is very different from a telnet connection.  When you connect to a 
distant computer via telnet, it's a continuous connection, like a phone 
conversation: you stay connected until you hang up.  But a Web connection 
is different, at least for the time being.   The only times you connect 
to the distant computer is when you click something.  The computer then 
feeds your computer the information, and terminates the connection when 
the information transfer is complete.  The connection isn't renewed until 
you ask for more information, by clicking on something else.  This is why 
web browsers are what are called off-line document readers, and it causes 
problems on most MOOs because if someone wants to send you information 
(perhaps they want to say "hi"), you won't get it until you reconnect to 
the main MOO computer.  We've taken care of that by having an `automatic 
update', in which your computer will automatically connect to the MOO 
every so often . . .</blockquote>

<FONT SIZE=4><P>MOOs can be divided into three main groups: (1) 
educational, Foreign Language, EFL/ESL (English as a Foreign 
Language/English as a Second Language), and research MOOs; (2) gaming 
MOOs; (3) social MOOs.  These categories are in no way mutually 
exclusive.  Often social MOOs, and sometimes educational and research 
MOOs, are set in a science-fiction (sci-fi) or fantasy setting, much like 
a gaming MOO.  All MOOs have social aspects.  With the exception of <A 
HREF="list.html#Zen">ZenMOO</A>, all MOOs are programmable, and could 
thus be considered research MOOs.  I have categorized <A 
HREF="list.html">my super MOO list</A> by what the main focus is.</p>

<P>It is not surprising that so many MOOs are socially oriented.  People 
are excited about this new form of interaction.  Communication in cyberspace 
allows for a safe environment to share ideas and allows for cheap access 
to people worldwide.  Cyberspace also creates a space for people to 
meet.  Where else would one meet a biologist in London and a student in 
Spain, let alone chat with them for free.  All this can be done from the 
comfort of your own home.  One can meet people worldwide in a space 
designed to promote discussion of a specific topic or simply for free 
socializing.  For example, <A HREF="list.html#Bio">BioMOO</A> is strictly 
for biologists and <a href="list.html#QMondo">QMondo</a> is a 
self-proclaimed gay MOO.</p>

<P>By the same token, educators are excited by the possibilities that 
this new technology offers.  They have a new way of encouraging students 
to write, they can connect classes worldwide, and they can help student 
overcome fear of the internet.  CMC (Computer Mediated Communication) 
offers a new way of examining language and communication.</p>

<P>Games are another obvious use for MOOs.  This is where they started 
and this is where they continue to grow.  There are many RPGs 
(Role-Playing Games) that users can become a part of.  This interactive 
gaming takes away the static nature of games.  This is why many popular 
computer games are now sold in network form (the ability to "connect" 
computers through networking so that players can play against each other 
rather than against the computer).</p>

<P>One surprising aspect of MOOs is the focus on sci-fi themes.  While 
MOOs could be used for almost anything, such as recreating historical 
events or exploring real life locations virtually, my search for and consequent 
<a href="list.html">listing of MOOs</a> finds that there is little use in 
these areas.  On the other hand, an unusually large number of MOOs have 
been used to create, or recreate from books and movies, the possible futures 
presented by sci-fi.</p>

<P>Computers and sci-fi have often been linked.  Searching for StarTrek on <A
HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</A> produces 4668 matches.  That is
over four thousand references to StarTrek on the Web.</p>

<P>Why is sci-fi so popular with people involved with computers and why 
are people interested in sci-fi so computer oriented?  Perhaps there is a 
type of personality that makes a person gravitate toward both computers 
and sci-fi.  Such a person might be a visionary, look towards the future, 
be technically oriented.  Perhaps the reason for the link between sci-fi 
and computers is the cognitive style of the individual, the way that such 
a person makes mental connections between things.  Such a person might be 
working in cutting edge (future) technology, such as computers, and would 
thus be very future oriented, and thus would find the futuristic aspects 
of sci-fi appealing.</p>

<P>Whatever the reasons that sci-fi and computers are linked, that 
link is self-perpetuating and thus is here to stay.  A market has been 
created for sci-fi literature which is computer oriented and for computer 
access which is sci-fi oriented, such as MOOs.  In working in either 
field, one is automatically exposed to the other.  As long as consumers 
continue to want these materials, sci-fi will continue to influence 
computer access and computer technologies will continue to permeate the 
sci-fi genre.</p></FONT>
