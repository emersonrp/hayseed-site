<h1>What's an Agent?</h1>

A software agent is a program that performs tasks for its user.  While this
may sound just like any program, agents have somewhat special properties,
which the enormous amount of media hype (and subsequent misuse of the term)
has clouded in recent years.<p>

For a fairly complete description, you should really see my
<em>What's an Agent, Anyway?  A Sociological Case Study</em> [written in 1993], which discusses
<a href="Julia-intro.html">Julia</a>, a
<a href="muds.html">MUD</a> robot.  It
uses Julia to define by example a good software agent, and also talks quite a
bit about the sociology behind user acceptance of agents; it's available in <a
href="Julia.html">HTML</a> (with some
active links) or in
<a href="Agents--Julia.ps">Postscript</a> or
<a href="Agents--Julia.pdf">PDF</a>
(either one of which will look better).<p>

If you want a superficial sketch of agents, consider that most definitions
involve some notion of:
<ul>
  <li> <em>trust</em>:  the agent will do what you think it will do,
  <li> <em>personalizability</em>:  the agent can be either learn
       or be explicitly taught what to do for each individual user, and
  <li> <em>autonomy</em>:  the agent is allowed to take at least some actions
       on the user's behalf, without permission or perhaps even notification.
</ul><p>

In addition, many agents also learn
(This can sometimes lead to problems of trying to learn too much and hence
running too slowly; for an example of approaches to ameliorate some of these
problems, check out this paper (in
<a href="Focus-of-Attention.ps">Postscript</a> or
<a href="Focus-of-Attention.pdf">PDF</a>), or
<a href="MS-Thesis-Document/">this thesis</a>,
with included <a href="MS-Thesis-Code/">code</a>.)<p>

Typical applications of agents include information filtering and information
discovery, although some are also used for <a
href="Julia-intro.html">entertainment</a>.
The <a href="http://agents.media.mit.edu/groups/agents/">Agents Group</a>
of the <a href="http://media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Laboratory</a> has built
agents that do <!-- a
