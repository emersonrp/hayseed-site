<P>
There is no question in my mind that Julia fits the category of agent.
To wit:
<P>
<UL><LI> <b>Autonomy.</b>  She carries out many independent actions in the mud.  In
fact, most of her time is spent pursuing a private agenda (mapping the
maze), which is nonetheless occasionally useful to her users (when they
ask for navigational assistance).  Note that this degree of autonomy is
<i>necessary</i> for her to perform her job:  it would do no good at all
for Julia to explicitly attempt to map the maze only when asked for
directions.  Such an action would take too long for the user to wait,
and simply cannot be sped up, either, since Julia must pause at least
momentarily at regular intervals to avoid spamming the server.
<P>
<LI> <b>Personalizability.</b>  Julia is personalizable to the extent that she
will remember certain preferences about her users.  For example, she can
be told someone's email address, and will remember that and disgorge it
again when asked to describe someone.  Most of her aspects of
personalizabilty are in fact of <i>negative</i> utility to other players,
though-except for keeping descriptions of individual players (which
would qualify her more as a database), her primary bit of
personalizability is to <i>avoid</i> players who have killed her recently,
or have been obnoxious in other ways (c.f. the example above in which
Johann killed her).
<P>
<LI> 
<b>Risk, trust, and graceful degradation.</b>  Julia's task is both social
and informational.  There are several mechanisms by which Julia might
`fail':
<UL><LI> Not even noticing that she has been addressed
<P>
<LI> Misparsing a statement and responding in a totally inappropriate way
<P>
<LI> Correctly parsing a statement, but producing incorrect information,
either accidentally or on purpose
</UL>
Julia quite frequently makes the first two types of mistakes, but such
mistakes carry with them extremely little risk.  The first type of
mistake may make her seem cold or uninterested in a player, but
presumably the player can deal with the affront to his or her ego.  The
second type of mistake is generally obvious (and often a dead giveaway
that Julia is a 'bot, for those who don't know yet), since we assume
that only human players interact with 'bots.  (This assumption is
generally true, since 'bots rarely speak unless spoken to, which tends
to leave all of them silent unless humans are around to start a
conversation.  Obviously, one can see different setups in which 'bots
would interact, potentially getting stuck in cycles of misparsed statements and
responses unless programmed to detect them, and so forth.)
<P>
It is only the third type of error which carries substantial risk, and,
even here, the risk is not that great.<A NAME=tex2html27 HREF=Julia.foot.html#154><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>  In tasks where her
information's reliability matters (e.g., player descriptions,
navigation, etc), she has never to my knowledge been observed to be
incorrect, with the possible exception of being slightly out of date if
someone changes a description or some bit of topology after she has last
seen it.  At worst, she may claim that her map does not work, and fail
to give navigational information at all.
<P>
Julia <i>does</i> deliberately mislead and provide false information in one
crucial area-that of whether she is a human or a 'bot.  This
particular piece of risk is something of a step function:  once one
realizes the truth, the risk is gone.  While some (like the unfortunate
Barry in the long transcript above) might argue that this is a serious
risk, the vast majority of those who meet her and were not clued in
ahead of time as to her nature do not find the discovery particularly
distressing.  On the other hand, her very accessibility, because of her
close approximation of human discourse, makes her much more valuable
than she might otherwise be-one is tempted to ask her useful questions
that she <i>might</i> not be able to answer, just because she deals so well
with so many other questions.  This encourages experimentation, which
encourages discovery.  A less human and less flexible interface would
tend to discourage this, causing people to either have to read
documentation about her (most wouldn't) or not ask her much.  Either
way, these outcomes would make her less useful.
<P>
<LI> <b>Discourse.</b>  Julia's discourse model, while primitive, appears
sufficient for the domain at hand.  Since the topics at hand don't
generally require more conversational memory than one or two exchanges,
the extent of her discourse modelling is limited more by its
breadth-by the stunningly simple parsing model employed.  (I'll have
more to say about the demands placed on Julia's handling of discourse
when I talk about domain immediately below.)
<P>
<LI> <b>Domain.</b>  Julia is situated in a mud, and therefore her environment
is conceptually rather simple.  Furthermore, she has access to just as
much sensor data as the human players, putting them on an even footing.
In fact, much of Julia's success can be traced to the wonderful domain
in which she finds herself situated.  In this bandwidth-limited space,
people expect other people to look exactly as Julia does-as a stream
of text.  And even when they're interacting with an entity known to be a
program, the text-only nature of the dialog prevents them from
expecting, say, a pop-up menu.  (If such things were available, people
could tell programs from people by knowing that programs can pop up
menus, whereas people use sentences.)  Yet the domain is not <i>so</i>
simple as to be uninteresting.  It contains not only a fascinating
sociological mix of human players, but objects with quite complicated,
constructed behaviors, which may be manipulated on an even footing by
both machines and people.
<P>
<LI> <b>Anthropomorphism.</b>  There's no question that Julia as an agent
depends upon anthropomorphism.  In this domain, though, that is both
natural and probably necessary.  Nonplayer objects are not generally
expected to be able to deal with free text, and not being able to use
free text would require each user of Julia to read documentation about
reasonable commands they could type and reasonable actions they could
expect.  Julia would <i>have</i> to appear at least as animated as, say, a
more obvious `robot' or a pet, given that she wanders around in the
maze; she cannot afford to resemble a static piece of furniture and
still get her job done.  Given an entity that moves of its own volition,
seems to have an independent agenda most of the time, and both processes
and emits natural language, if it was <i>not</i> anthropomorphized, users
would tend to do so anyway (pets get this treatment, as well as much
simpler mechanisms).  Thus, anthropomorphizing her makes it easier to
determine how to relate to her and how to get her to do one's bidding.
<P>
<LI> <b>Expectations.</b>  The domain of a mud is ideal in correctly setting
expectations about the reliability and power of an agent such as Julia.
Since the setting is fundamentally playful, and usually also somewhat
unpredictable, it is natural to interact with playful and unpredictable
characters (be they machines or humans).  Nothing in a mud is truly
life-critical, hence the user generally does not have very high
expectations of reliability, which lets Julia get away with a lot of
nonoptimal behavior that could never be tolerated in, e.g., an airplane
cockpit guidance system.
