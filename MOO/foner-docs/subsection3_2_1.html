<P>
This particular agent is called <a href="http://www.lazytoad.com/lti/julia/"><i>Julia</i></a>, and was written by Michael
Loren (`Fuzzy') Mauldin (<a href="http://www.lazytoad.com/lti/">&lt;mlm@cs.cmu.edu&gt;</a>) at the Center for Machine
Translation at Carnegie-Mellon University.  Julia is actually the
crowning example of a whole class of similar agents, called
<i>Maas-Neotek<A NAME=tex2html6 HREF=Julia.foot.html#149><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> robots</i>, of which <i>Colin</i> is the
name of the prototypical, unmodified robot (available via <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mnbotmolitor/">sourceforge</a><sup>*</sup>).
<P>
Julia is a TinyMUD<A NAME=tex2html7 HREF=Julia.foot.html#150><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> robot.  She<A NAME=tex2html8 HREF=Julia.foot.html#29><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> can run on just about any
TinyMUD, and there is little a priori reason why, with slight
modifications, she couldn't run on most types of muds, be they TinyMUDs,
MOOs, MUSHes, or what-have-you.  She connects as any human player on the
mud would, via a telnet connection-she does
<i>not</i> run on the mud server itself.  (This is known as a `client
'bot', as opposed to a `server 'bot', and is based on the distinction
between clients-humans-and servers-the program containing the mud
database.)  Therefore, she does not bog down the server, nor does she
have to be written in a mud programming language such as MUSH; instead,
she is written in C, and runs on a workstation in Pittsburgh.
<P>
Julia's source code is not available to the general public, because she
has been entered at various times in the Loebner Turing-Test
competition.  However, Fuzzy<A NAME=tex2html9 HREF=Julia.foot.html#31><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> claims<A NAME=tex2html10 HREF=Julia.foot.html#32><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> that 85%of Julia's code is
actually the same as Colin, the prototypical robot, and Colin's code is
freely available.<A NAME=tex2html11 HREF=Julia.foot.html#151><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>  Many of the transcripts below were acquired when she
ran on Time Traveller, which ran until recently at
&lt;betz.biostr.washington.edu, port 4096&gt;, but has since ceased
operations.  Julia is currently (as of April 28, 1993) running on at
least DruidMUCK (&lt;freedom.nmsu.edu, port 4201&gt;), and perhaps elsewhere on
the Internet as well.<A NAME=tex2html12 HREF=Julia.foot.html#37><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
