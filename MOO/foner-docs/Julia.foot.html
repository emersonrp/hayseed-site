<A NAME=9><DT>...decades, <DD>Vannevar Bush <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/">spoke
of such a thing</a> in the late fifties and early sixties, as did Doug
Englebart.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=10><DT>...agents <DD>A 'learning
interface' agent, as opposed to any other kind of agent, is one that
uses machine-learning techniques to present a pseudo-'intelligent' user
interface in its actions.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=15><DT>...Phil, <DD>An expensively-produced, ten-minute Apple promo video which
talked about what agent technology might look like twenty years from now
also named its 'agent' Phil, a suspicious similarity...</A>
<P>
<A NAME=148><DT>...'thinking' <DD>Section heading, 'How Agents Think and Learn', <i>Mass
High Tech</i>, Volume 10, Number 23, November 2-15, 1992.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=149><DT>... <DD>A reference to a multinational corporation from
William Gibson's book <i>Neuromancer</i>.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=150><DT>...TinyMUD <DD>TinyMUD is a type of <i>mud</i>, a specific type of
more than a dozen different types of muds.  Muds in general are a type
of multiperson text-based virtual reality.  For more information about
muds, see, for example, Pavel Curtis, 'Mudding: Social Phenomena in
Text-Based Virtual Realities', Proceedings of DIAC '92, which is
available via anonymous ftp from
parcftp.xerox.com:pub/MOO/papers/DIAC92.{ps, txt}; or the MUD
frequently-asked-questions list for the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.mud,
available via anonymous ftp from
moebius.math.okstate.edu:/pub/muds/misc/mud-faq.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=29><DT>...She <DD>I
usually don't anthropomorphize programs, but Julia is an exception.  I
will have more to say about this later.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=31><DT>...Fuzzy <DD>Michael Mauldin's nickname and mud
handle.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=32><DT>...claims <DD>Private communication.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=151><DT>...available. <DD>For example, the robot Xeglin, running on Space
Madness (&lt;riemann.math.okstate.edu, port 6250&gt;) is a slightly-modified
version of Colin.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=37><DT>...well. <DD>Since Julia runs on a workstation and telnets
in as a normal character, multiple instantiations of the same code can
run concurrently, each connecting to one particular mud.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=40><DT>...whisper <DD>A whisper is a private
communication.  The intended target hears it, but no one else in the
room does.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=46><DT>...reason.) <DD>This particular room
is rather special to Julia:  she can play Hearts, and will join a game
if asked.  This is one reason why she claimed to have received almost
fifty thousand utterances in this room in her time in it.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=49><DT>...spam <DD>This is mud
jargon for overloading the server.  This can happen via a program
running on the server that monopolizes its resources in some way, or via
a client that issues inhumanly too many commands too fast, as a program
might.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=50><DT>...poll <DD>A 'Delphi poll' is a technique for getting approximate
information.  It assumes that, even if no one actually knows the right
answer to a question, some sort of average of all of their answers might
be correct.  This technique actually works, some of the time...</A>
<P>
<A NAME=52><DT>...machine. <DD>Were Julia written in Lisp
and not C, she would have bignum arithmetic available, which can express
arbitrarily large numbers exactly.  Her inability to cons bigna was my
first clue, before I obtained Colin's source code, that she was most
likely written in C and not Lisp.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=56><DT>...difficult. <DD>This is, after all, one of the reasons that
human languages have pronouns.  Even signed languages use this concept,
by assigning spatial positions in the signers' visual fields and
pointing to them, where speakers would use pronouns.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=57><DT>...IRC <DD>IRC, or 'Internet Relay Chat', is a sort
of Internet equivalent of the 1970's CB-radio craze, though with
important differences.  For more details, see Elizabeth Reid,
'Electropolis: Communication and Community on Internet Relay Chat,'
Bachelors thesis, University of Melbourne, 1991, which is available via
anonymous ftp from
freebie.engin.umich.edu:/pub/text/IRCThesis/electropolis{ps,text}.Z.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=58><DT>...clever <DD>On Fuzzy's
part, of course.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=153><DT>...e. <DD>It is probably also a veiled reference to
the large number of computers either blown up or disabled in the
original <i>Star Trek</i> series, when deliberately asked to compute such
computationally infinite quantities.  One might contend that such
computer systems were poorly designed, but that is beside the point.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=81><DT>...message, <DD>If you page her with a message,
she'll answer the message, but stay where she is.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=83><DT>...old, <DD>As of this writing, Julia claims to be 3 years
and 4 months old...</A>
<P>
<A NAME=84><DT>...cujmeister. <DD>Julia occasionally makes up
nicknames for people based on their character's name.  I strongly
suspect that the first three letters of the 'real' character's name
(which Fuzzy changed to 'barry' in this transcript) were 'cuj'.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=85><DT>...barry. <DD>Note that
even this bizarre response does not appear to have tipped Barry off...</A>
<P>
<A NAME=82><DT>...above... <DD>Lucretia is left as
an exercise, as is determining how it was that Xeglon put that comment
there, being a 'bot and all.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=86><DT>...DruidMUCK <DD>My thanks to Leira for the referral.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=87><DT>...time). <DD>One might consider that even a
telephone interview is happening 'in cyberspace'-where are you when
you're on the phone?-but most people consider the telephone to be by
now too prosaic a piece of equipment to qualify for the name.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=88><DT>...Pittsburgh? <DD>This is a thought balloon.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=89><DT>...it. <DD>Nowhere but on the Lisp Machine
have I seen a similar process be quite so easy, and even there the
interface isn't in natural language.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=90><DT>...elthar <DD>Note that elthar, like many mudders, spells
his name using lower case, so that is the case I use later.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=154><DT>...great. <DD><i>No</i> risk in a mud can be
particularly great these days, since muds do not generally side-effect
the 'real world' in any way-though this may change:  JaysHouseMOO
(&lt;theory.cs.mankato.msus.edu, port 1709&gt;) is doing considerable work on
systems that allow MOOers to interact with the information resources of
the Internet, as are certain other muds).  And even a player who is
badly lost and steps into the wrong room can usually recover in <i>some</i>
fashion.  The 'risks' are greatest in RPG muds, where one might
potentially lose a character, and here one generally doesn't trust 'bots
more than one might trust a monster or a stranger.</A>
<P>
<A NAME=155><DT>...risks. <DD>In 'Let Your Agents Do The Walking' (Steven
Levy, <i>MacWorld</i>, May 1993, p. 42), Levy describes using 'Magnet' for a
simple file identification and movement task.  When he specified the
'wrong' directory in which to put the results (by improperly
capitalizing it, despite the fact that Macintosh filesystems are
specified as being case-insensitive for lookup), the 'agent' silently
threw everything it found in the trash!</A>
<P>
<A NAME=146><DT>...persists. <DD>Modern industrial society has largely replaced physical
(human) slavery with machines, be they constructed out of inorganic
matter or bred as domestic animals.  Mental tasks with a large
'cognitive' component are the last bastion where human-level performance
is often needed, but is unobtainable without actual humans to do it.</A>
