So why is Julia such a good example of an agent, and what can we learn
from her sociology?  In my view, anything that calls itself an `agent'
has several criteria it must pass, in one way or another, to be
distinctly an agent and not something else.  Let's tackle them one at a
time, in outline form.  First, I'll lay down the basic issues, then
examine them in the light of an example such as Julia.
