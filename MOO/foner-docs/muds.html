<h1>MUDs:  Some quick pointers</h1>

If you'd like to know more about MUDs, you might want to check out Jennifer
Smith's <a
href="http://w2.eff.org/Net_culture/Net_info/Resources/mud.faq">Frequently Asked
Questions:  Basic Information about MUDs and MUDing</a>.  For another
fascinating resource (and one that's better linked into the Web), consult <a
href="http://www.lpbtales.com/">Lauren Burka's</a> <a
href="http://www.linnaean.org/~lpb/muddex/">Muddex</a>.<p>

You might also want to look at Amy Bruckman's <a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~asb/papers/identity-workshop.ps">Identity
Workshop:  Emergent Social and Psychological Phenomena in Text-Based Virtual
Reality</a>.<p>

And, of course, if you're interested in a sociological analysis of one
particular agent and MUDs, check out Lenny Foner's <em>
