The mind--the associative, cooperative mind--its extension in culture and
realization in technique, is the most important means of production. The most
important product of the mind is a produced and sustained reality. (Carey
1988)</p><p>
</p><p>
	For a long time I resisted the temptation to enter the worlds of textual
virtual realities known as M*s.  I was first shown them in 1992, and naturally
turned up my nose at the socially-questionable ''virtual" life of my geekier
friends at the technical institute where I worked.  I had a <i>real  </i>life,
I didn't need an electronically-mediated one.  And then MediaMOO came along.</p><p>
	<b>3Cyberconf will never end...<i>virtually</i>!</b> exclaimed the headline of
the brochure.  It was 1993, and Amy Bruckman had just opened MediaMOO, billed
as a virtual space where cyber-colleagues could socialize, network, and perhaps
even do research.  I was looking for a career change and trying to get into
graduate school. It was a tempting idea to meet on neutral and casual grounds
with knowledgeable professors and graduate students who shared my newfound
interest in technology and gender.  I logged on as a guest and used what
minimal help information I had to begin communicating and navigating within the
scrolling ASCII universe.  My first interactions were not with other characters
but with research tools provided in the main entrance room.  I then struck up a
few conversations with characters, who gladly introduced me to their virtual
colleagues and helped me navigate the world.</p><p>
	Soon I had found a few people who shared some of my interests and decided to
get a full-fledged character;  in a few hours, Hawthorne was born. She was a
player-object with filled descriptions, functional verbs, and a programmer's
bit.  Hawthorne met more people...then she built the free-standing porch of a
deteriorated Southern plantation mansion and connected it to the homes of her
friends...then she built a perpetually autumn-struck tree in the front
yard...then she joined a second MOO devoted to education, where her best MOO
friend was an administrator...then she fell in love with him...then she learned
how to program...then she built an on-line interactive art exhibition...then
she.... </p><p>
</p><p>
	Similarly anecdotal and equally frivolous elaborations are easy to come by and
perhaps even too plentiful in the ever-increasing writing about M*s.  While
most writing has been superficial and journalistic, plenty of this output has
emanated from the universities. It seems that academicians are predictably
susceptible to the experiential seduction of living in and through text.  </p><p>
To some degree, this paper will be no exception to that academic
self-reflexivity. My interest in promoting the use of M*s is a direct outgrowth
of my intimate experience with them;  I too was seduced by living in the words.
Yet I hope to take thought about M*s, especially the variety known as MOOs, one
more step away from the usual explorations, and at least two from their
original purposes.  I'd like to consider whether my experiences in MOOs are
generalizable to groups and individuals less like myself; I hope that the
text-world is, if not universal, at least multivalent.</p><p>
	These networked ASCII spaces began as MUDs, the fantastical playgrounds for
the machine-immersed computer hackers at various universities around the world.
Now, the M*s current vogue with educators can be largely attributed to
scholars' realization that, despite their technologically-mediated format, M*s
are fulfilling a timeless attraction to the written word and its creative
manipulation.  As useful as M*s are for fostering and nurturing educational and
social activity, they are under-utilized if they stay within the school, more
particularly university, setting.  I want to explore how or indeed <i>if
</i>the qualities of MOOs could be useful for achieving goals outside of the
academe. </p><p>
	However, my inquiry will be even more restrictive.  While investigations are
currently underway to explore how M*s might be useful in business<a href="http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/%7Emoboid/border/socMOOs_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a> no one has yet explored how real-time
textual worlds might support the activities of social service and
not-for-profit organizations.  It is my thesis that, while not appropriate to
all groups, MOOs provide a way of communicating, socializing, and
information-sharing from which many service and activist organizations could
benefit.  According to Willard Uncapher, one of the most important elements in
attracting alternative groups to use new forms of technology is to provide a
compelling reason to do so<a href="http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/%7Emoboid/border/socMOOs_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a>.  A medium must
provide features which are not available elsewhere;  I will assert that
real-time, situated, constructable MOOspaces are such a medium.  Yet in the
case of computerized text, those who wish to involve disenfranchised cultures
need to proceed with caution, as best supported perhaps by James Carey:</p><p>
</p><p>
Computer information systems are not merely objective information-recording
devices.  They are emanations of attitudes and hopes. The subjective location
of such attitudes and hopes remains vested in the servants of the institutional
monopoly of foreknowledge--for instance, the Rand Corporation.  The "idea of
information" is another way past the real political factors of class, status,
and power, but these formidable realities cannot be dissolved into a future
where they are presumed not to exist because they have been absorbed and
transformed by the computational machinery.(Carey 1988)<a href="http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/%7Emoboid/border/socMOOs_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a> </p><p>
</p><p>
	In this paper I shall discuss aspects of the M* medium, particularly the MOO
derivative, in order to elaborate their structural and conceptual  advantages
and failings, and point towards changes which would need to take place in order
to accommodate a wider variety of users. Throughout, I shall refer to Carey and
others who have spoken on the cultural implications of new communications
technologies, in order to proactively consider the effects that MOO interaction
might have on American social groups which are not founded on the hierarchical,
militaristic, and Western value system which engendered the Internet.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>introduction</b></p><p>
<b></b></p><p>
<b></b>Modern computer enthusiasts may be willing to share their data with
anybody.  What they are not willing to relinquish as readily is the entire
technocratic world view that determines what qualifies as an acceptable or
valuable fact.  What they monopolize is not the body of data itself but the
approved, certified, sanctioned, official mode of thought--indeed the
definition of what it means to be reasonable.  And this is possible because of
a persistent confusion between information and knowledge. (Carey 1988)</p><p>
</p><p>
	The Internet has been much touted as a cure for some of what ails society,
especially in America.  Its proponents have argued that the Net democratizes
and equalizes. They claim that alternative voices are more likely to be heard
in widespread person-to-person networked communication systems than ever before
was possible through one-to-many broadcast media systems.  	Various detractors,
or at least cautionary types, have countered that the predominant format of the
Internet, keyboarded ASCII characters, is inherently exclusive of most of the
world's cultures. They point out that the Internet's origins in the cold war
techno-military enterprise predisposes it to a certain type of discourse
regardless of the medium's possibilities. Additionally, they argue that access
inequity divides the information haves and have-nots down already too-familiar
socio-economic lines.  I believe that nowhere are the possibilities <i>and</i>
limitations of the networked typewritten word more evident than in the virtual
textual realities known collectively as M*s. </p><p>
	Before going on to examine the characteristic attributes of M*s, I will give a
brief account of what M*s <i>do</i>, what some are like to interact with and
within, and give a short account of the more recent changes they have gone
through since their creation. This discussion will include an explanation of
the MOO version of M*, because the MOO variant is the model taken up by almost
every educational and professional M*, and would, for reasons which I will
discuss, be the best foundation for a service-oriented and decentralized
textual world.</p><p>
	M*s began as MUDs, or Multi-User Dungeons, on-line versions of the popular
Dungeons and Dragons role-playing games. They are self-contained (though
sometimes linked) textual 'worlds' in which remotely-located participants can
interact through a software program and the database which that program
manipulates.  When users connect to these computers, they enter 'characters',
virtual personas through whom they navigate the textual spaces.  Characters are
self-determined;  a user generally has no obligation to describe themselves
accurately, though norms on this matter vary between M*s.  Role-playing games
absolutely necessitate fictional representations, most social and
subject-oriented M*s allow for a wide variety of representational types, and
some professional M*s request that users describe themselves 'realistically'.
Many M*s have a 'theme' to which characters must adhere.  </p><p>
	Once within a M*, characters navigate and communicate with other characters
using special commands particular to the programming code of the M*.   At this
point I will elaborate on the distinctions between M*s in general and the M*
version known as MOO, because the programming code of this variation makes it
particularly appropriate for the implementation of more egalitarian,
educational, user-created virtual spaces.  </p><p>
	MOO code is the most powerful and versatile of M* languages. It is written in
C to mimic many of the operations of the Unix operating system which supports
it, using an object-oriented data structure.  This means that each person,
place, or thing in a MOO is a unique 'object', distinguished by its 'object
number'.   Objects contain 'verbs' and 'properties' which determine how they
appear and how they interact with other objects.  Since every person is an
object, these verbs shape all of the interpersonal relationships in textual
worlds. Perhaps the most important element of the MOO coding language is that
it is designed to be written from <i>within</i> the MOO itself: "[Both] Unix
and MOO function as command interpreters and as programming environments.  It
is this...more than any other single feature, that unites MOOcode with Unix and
distinguishes it from other forms of gaming and/or virtual-reality
environments" (Unsworth 1994).  Users create the objects and write code while
inhabiting both; in MOOs, users literally build themselves and their
surroundings.</p><p>
	The MOOcode is usually made available to any user who cares to learn it. Few
MOOs allow unlimited use of programming and database resources, because of
sheer space limitations on the machines which host the MOO databases. In most
cases, however, users can increase their access to limited resources if they
demonstrate a knowledge of the environment  by adding useful artifacts to the
community.  Exemplifying the constructivist theory that innovations and
learning come from giving individuals access to tools and allowing them to
play, MOO structure is not as rigid or arbitrary as other M*s regarding who can
or cannot acquire access to the power to build the world.  This feature makes
the MOO format more amenable to textual realities which would support less
hierarchical organizations.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>history</b></p><p>
<b></b></p><p>
The social forms and relations technology makes possible are themselves
imagined in and anticipated by the technology.  Technique is vectoral and not
merely neutral in the historical process. A building, its precise architecture,
anticipates and imagines the social relations that it permits and desires.  So
does a television signal.  Social relations of class, status, and power demand
both a conceptual structure of persons and a technology to effectuate them.
Conceptual structures, in turn, never float free of the expressive forms that
realize them or the social relations that make them active agents. (Carey
1988)</p><p>
</p><p>
	The origins and current direction of the Internet-as-a-whole set the tone for
limiting broad participation by disenfranchised groups.  Established as a
robust communications system for the military as ARPANet and DARPANet, the
Internet soon connected scientific and academic research institutions.  The
Internet's growth since (over the last five years, especially) has increased
the number of non-technologists participating, but the Net retains some of the
cultural attributes of the social segment which nurtured it.  There is still a
residue of arcane exclusivity clinging to the most powerful and versatile
Internet tools like Archie and ftp. Limited Internet services are available
only to those non-academics who can afford to purchase them from one of the
national services like America OnLine; more extensive access, offset by cruder
interfaces is available through smaller companies like Austin's Illuminati
OnLine.   Many of the most aggressive recent Internet joiners are businesses,
eager to utilize a new means of distribution for their products and services
now that the distributed hypermedia application known as the WorldWideWeb has
made the Internet a more visual  and auditory medium.  While some organizations
and individuals are seeking to offset this trend toward commercialization by
giving financial and political support to open-access community networks, the
Net remains the playground of its privileged, highly-educated incipient
users.</p><p>
	Despite this movement toward more commercial participation, the Internet is
also increasingly being seen as a useful communications tool by a wide variety
of non-profit and community-minded groups. Among the variety of social service
organizations which have used the various channels of the Internet, almost none
have employed MOOs to further their ends. This is most likely because the
history of M*s has followed a path contrary to those of most other Internet
tools.  While services such as email, Usenet, and gopher were conceived as
government or business tools, only later applied to recreational or
non-official purposes, the M*s were created as explicitly recreational and then
social spaces, and later adapted to more utilitarian purposes by users who saw
their unique and useful characteristics.  </p><p>
	Because of this reverse use-development, the M*s are still trying to overcome
a certain reputation for frivolity.  Additionally, M*s continue to be much
noted and usually berated for their addictive, immersive qualities.   M*s are
the only variety of Internet tool to be categorically banned from some academic
systems, under the pretense of their detrimental affect on users who drop all
other activities, including schoolwork, to spend countless hours immersed in a
shared hallucinatory fantasy.  But the development of MOOs away from the
sheerly escapist game of most M*s and toward a more open-ended, participatory,
and constructivist mode of operation has attracted the Internet-savvy
professors and graduate colleagues of those game-addicted undergraduates.</p><p>
	Thus the great majority of non-game M*s, are confined to academic and
educational uses.  Many M*s exist to link researchers and practitioners in a
specific field; there are special M*s for physicists, biologists, and writers.
Other M*s embody the  next logical step that real-time networked interaction
suggests: distance education.  At least three independent educational
organizations are currently operating on the Internet, and all incorporate MOOs
as important elements<a href="http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/%7Emoboid/border/socMOOs_fn.html#fn3">[4]</a>. </p><p>
</p><p>
<b>access</b></p><p>
<b></b></p><p>
<b></b>In our time reality is scarce because of access: so few command the
machinery for its determination.  Some get to speak and some to listen, some to
write and some to read, some to film and some to view.  It is fine to be told
we are the species that actively creates the world and then simultaneously to
be told that we are part of the subspecies denied access to the machinery by
which that miracle is pulled off.(Carey 1988)</p><p>
</p><p>
	Despite increasing use in the academy, M*s are one of the most arcane and
invisible Internet services.  Of the multiplying M* appearances in the media,
most are sensationalist, highlighting M*s disadvantages, tensions, or
eccentricities while avoiding discussion of their potential uses, short of the
masturbatory.  But M*s' invisibility is of an even more substantial nature than
that provided by misrepresentation in the press.  They are simply not provided
as an Internet service in themselves to the large part of Internet users.
Schools that readily offer email, gopher, FTP, WorldWideWeb, newsgroups, and
other more explicitly information-retrieval tools, often with sophisticated
interfaces and help information, do not offer M* interfaces or even suggest M*s
as valuable activities.  Most users find out from friends, from the few
newsgroups dedicated to M*dom, or from print sources such as Wired or, now,
more mainstream magazines like Newsweek.  And in many commercial services as
they currently stand, users do not have access to telnet, the most basic
requirement for accessing M* worlds.  Local Internet account providers are the
most amenable to M*s; some even sponsor their own textual worlds.</p><p>
	Before not-for-profits and social service organizations can participate in a
widely-distributed computer communications medium, certain minimal requirements
must be met.  Each user must have access to a computer, a modem,  a telephone
link to the outside world, and to the Internet. The first three requirements
are the simplest to meet, although some parts of the world still lack even
reliable telephone communications.  In America,  rural areas are more easily
served than comparable locations in many other countries because of the
universal telephony policy here, though calling rates can be higher for
residents of a dispersed countryside than those for urban dwellers.</p><p>
	Because the technical hardware requirements are so low for navigating the
textual interface of M*s, most organizations will be able to use the hardware
they already own or can most easily acquire.  Many organizations receive used
or new computer equipment from businesses who donate to charitable
organizations to receive tax credits.  Consultants now advise not-for-profits
to treat computer equipment as they would any non-cash donation, assessing its
value and determining its usefulness before accepting it (Buchholz 1994).  Yet
almost any donated equipment is useful for the purposes of connecting to the
textual realms of the Internet, including M*s.  The user's simple terminal can
become in essence an input/output device to access certain computing resources
of a powerful workstation which houses the M* database and programming
language.</p><p>
	The histories of currently successful asynchronous grassroots computer
networks could offer possible routes for MOOs and their would-be social service
users to take in the search for financial support. Most alternative computer
networks rely on subscriptions if they are national, like Peacenet, or public
support through government funding if they are local, like the many regional
freenets. In some cases, networks are able to acquire startup grants.  Big Sky
Telegraph in western Montana began with two grants of 50,000 each, from MJ
Murdoch Charitable Trust and Mountain Bell Foundation. The latter is associated
with the national company US West, and according to Uncapher, the acquisition
of that grant can be attributed in large part to the previous corporate
contacts of the BST's founders (Uncapher 1994).  More official means for
acquiring funding must develop before less "connected" organizations can afford
to form the structures needed to begin interacting on-line.</p><p>
	Due to the current configuration of the Internet, it would be unrealistic to
expect underfunded agencies to establish their own Internet nodes and hire
support people to maintain them.  Some undoubtedly will be able to take on this
labor-intensive task, yet other avenues must be explored if a significant
number of organizations are to acquire access.  One way would be the donation
of connections by previously-established Internet providers.  What sorts of
access providers could afford to donate connections to non-profits?
Universities might, but their highly departmentalized and bureaucratic
structures would make such activities cumbersome, and probably dependent on the
individual initiative of someone employed within a particular institution.  An
encouraging exception to this explanation is CapAccess, the District of
Columbia community network, which is sponsored by George Washington University
and houses the M* ViBES--the Virtual Interactive Blair Environment System, as
well as a collection of publications about textual worlds.</p><p>
	Service-providing companies are in a better position to donate access, since
they operate with a pay-per-user scheme and can simply donate what they would
usually sell.  Tax credits for such donations, as with equipment and cash
donations, might be incentive enough to motivate corporations' charitable
behavior.  Otherwise, the simple fact of positive public relations might be a
sufficient enticement.  </p><p>
	Until more providers begin offering basic Internet services like Telnet,
however, such donations would not be useful for the purposes which this paper
addresses.  Many localized providers offer full Internet gateways, but due to
their small size, may be restricted in the amount of resources they could spare
for charitable purposes.  Of course, their local emphasis could also translate
into such companies becoming vital community resources, providing access to or
even housing MOO databases which serve a particular local constituency; an
environmental MOO based in Eugene, Oregon is a hypothetical example.  Yet
currently non-university, non-government Internet access provision is spread
inconsistently across the United States. Some towns, like Austin, have a number
of independent providers, while most US. cities, including many with major
universities, have none (Uncapher 1995).  An increase in the sheer numbers as
well as in the community responsibility of such providers would be a step
towards improving the chances that social service MOOs could exist.</p><p>
	The major on-line service providers offer different challenges to the
non-profit organization hoping to acquire access to MOOs.  Most are reluctant
to widen their Internet gateways from fear of outside competition for their
similar but generally inferior in-house services.  In addition, mainstream
on-line services carefully design their user interfaces to make on-line
activity simple, using icons, windows and menus. While asynchronous services
like email can be provided in this manner quite easily, the more powerful but
raw tools like Telnet must be controlled using line commands, and would create
more telephone traffic to their call-in technical assistance centers than such
companies are willing to tolerate. Telnet access, which is in essence direct
access to a remotely-located computer, also poses security risks that major
corporations are not willing to assume (Kastner 1995). But while
commercially-sponsored chat lines and public forums mimic some of the MOOs'
more superficial features, they cannot substitute for the more rich
interactivity and temporal persistence of  MOOs. </p><p>
<b></b></p><p>
<b>cultural amplification</b></p><p>
<b></b></p><p>
Knowledge is, after all, paradigmatic. It is not given in experience as data.
There is no such thing as "information" about the world devoid of conceptual
systems that create and define the world in the act of discovering it. Such
paradigms are present in information systems; they are metainformational,
contained in computer programs, statistical devices, information storage and
retrieval codes, technical theories that predefine information, and perhaps
most important in systems of binary opposition, that lingua franca of modern
science.... Moreover, as one hopes the history and sociology of science have
finally established, paradigms are not independent of exterior biases and
purposes; they instead express a value-laden rationale in technical language.
(Carey 1988) </p><p>
</p><p>
	There has been some concern over the "cultural amplification characteristics"
that computers promote, especially in regard to children now being reared
immersed in computer technology.  Computers are said to condition the way our
culture thinks about proper forms of reasoning and 'truth.' C.A. Bowers argues
that this computational model of reality predisposes Westerners to an
ecologically unsustainable value system (Bowers 1993).  </p><p>
	If this is indeed the case, what are the implications of a completely
computer-mediated reality for activist or social service networks, such as
those providing birth control or encouraging organic farming, whose explicit
goal is to fight non-sustainability?  Are such organizations nullifying their
work by taking part in an activity which may run contrary to their ideals?
Additionally, the explicitly Western values which Bowers says computers promote
are situated in opposition to less anthropocentric values and practices
--cultures-- of various indigenous groups.  Would such cultures be altered by
extensive contact with the Western value systems embedded in computer
technology?</p><p>
	While most proponents of computer technology would characterize computers as
'empty slates', neutral ground upon which any culture could inscribe its world
view, Bowers argues that computers, developed by individuals of a specific
(Lockean/Cartesian) mindset, promotes compartmentalization and fragmentation.
The latter is certainly true of Unix, the foundational system of all textual
worlds, as I will elaborate here. These Western values, says Bowers, stand
contrary to the holistic and non-human-centered view of reality required of
humans living sustainably with the earth.</p><p>
	MOOcode and the Unix which supports it have culturally-determined
characteristics which constrain their appropriateness for non-hierarchical
organizations.  MOO scholars have pointed to the structure of the MOO
environment itself as a determinant towards a particular socio-political
relationship amongst characters<a href="http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/%7Emoboid/border/socMOOs_fn.html#fn4">[5]</a> . The MOO
system is a reflection of the UNIX system which houses it, and:</p><p>
</p><p>
...the constellation of cultural elements gathered together in Unix's basic
operating principles seems particularly western and capitalist--not
surprisingly, given that its creators were human extensions of one of the
largest accumulations of capital in the western world.  On the other hand, this
tool, shaped though it was by the notions of ownership and exclusivity, spawned
a culture of cooperation, of homemade code, of user-contributed modifications
and improvements. (Unsworth 1994)</p><p>
</p><p>
UNIX is the time-sharing operating system which allows multiple individuals to
use a central terminal simultaneously;  it is the programming environment
underlying all Internet commands and services.  The UNIX system is based on a
hierarchical structure of access to files and commands, which is matched in
MOOs by the differing levels of situational control given to 'classes' of
characters.  </p><p>
	Yet on the other hand, the Unix system was developed explicitly to facilitate
point-to-point computer-mediated-communication and mutually-beneficial
information sharing as stated here by one of its developers, : "We knew from
experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by
remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a
terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication. (Ritchie
1984, quoted in Unsworth 1994)</p><p>
	It is from this culture of communally-shared knowledge that computer
conferencing and what is now known as Usenet first emerged (Uncapher). MOOs,
similarly, are explicitly social and rely on an ethic of mutual player
'inter-assistance' in communicating, navigating, and eventually code-writing.
Newcomers to the programming code, or 'newbies,' tend to seek help from other
characters  rather than manuals or tutorials written for that purpose. Unix's
tension between the built-in access hierarchy and the ethic of free sharing of
information is mirrored in the MOO code, and thus the MOO society. </p><p>
 	When bringing alternatively organized groups into MOOs as with any managed,
distributed system, administrators will need to pay close attention from the
inception in order to minimize the exclusionary effects of unevenly distributed
computational resources.  The way that most of the more egalitarian MOOs
currently negotiate this division is to allow every character, upon joining the
MOO, the ability to both build and program.  While some users might not
immediately utilize all of the available programming resources, they will be
free to do so at any time.  </p><p>
	Alternately, a MOO can establish a board of elected administrators and attempt
to recruit a diversity of participants to administrative and technical
positions.  While 'representative democracy' or even 'true democracy' have both
been and are currently being attempted at various textual locations, neither
ideology has completely survived upon being transported into the
security-driven structure of computer-mediated worlds.  There seems to be no
alternative at present to at least a two-tiered structure, with a small number
individuals performing technical and possibly socially administrative tasks.
It is conceptually possible that groups of users could form a mutually
technically knowledgeable, and thus even less hierarchical,  MOO communities,
but such an effort might be a poor use of energies for already over-worked
social service providers and activists with extensive real-world
responsibilities.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>interface</b></p><p>
<b></b></p><p>
We associate democracy with widespread literacy and a world of knowledge as
transcending political units. Yet even though literacy can give rise to a form
of democracy, it also makes impossible demands.  Literacy produces instability
and inconsistency because the written tradition is participated in so unevenly.
(Carey 1988)</p><p>
</p><p>
	The most immediately noticeable, consistently fascinating, and ultimately
frustrating feature of MOO interaction is that it all takes place within the
confines of ASCII text scrolling across a user's screen.  It is this fact more
than any other which determines who will and will not be able to benefit from
occupation of MOO spaces.  Firstly, there is reason to question the ability of
ASCII textual realities to literally "represent" non-Western and even
non-English-speaking individuals and their cultures.  Whether they be
fantastical or realistic, MOOs purport to represent individuals.  Many
cultures, including many Native American tribes, rely on verbal, visual, and
ceremonial knowledge in a cultural melieu which is not replicable by
standardized typewritten characters.  Nevertheless, Native Americans have been
some of the most active participants in other realms of grassroots computerized
telecommunications, a fact which bodes well for the participation of some
non-Western societies in textual worlds.  A solution which has been tried in
relation to Native Americans is to instruct a group of indigenous peoples in
the ways of a technology, enabling them to use their knowledge of their own
culture to determine the relative appropriateness of different computer uses
rather than insisting upon blanket acceptance or rejection of a particular
change (Telluride Institute 1993). </p><p>
	Despite the limitations of the English-biased ASCII text system, there exist
MOOs in a few other languages; currently there are French, Italian, Spanish and
multi-lingual MOOs.  However, these spaces are still based on an English
programming language, which all MOO administrators must learn.  Foreign words
are only substituted for the commands that average participants use, in order
to minimize the extra processing load on the host computers. And notably, the
languages currently represented in MOOs are those which use characters within
or closely related to ASCII code.  While these variations do provide some
diversity, they are far from representative of the world's languages, are under
numbered, and seemingly only lightly used, compared to English language MOOs
with other purposes.  This is hardly surprising given the minimal access to
computer communication services available to most of the world's population.
But the difficulties of MOO interface go beyond language to the computer
hardware and software itself.</p><p>
	The ontology of the M*s rests on a particular trade-off.  On one hand, they
actually require very little hardware and software for an end-user to
participate.  Any personal computer connected by modem to a basic Internet
account will work; ASCII character transmission requires very little bandwidth
compared to other media such as sound and graphics.  Many people currently
involved in M*s use early model computers and as low as 1200 baud modems to
connect from their homes.  Slow modems can create frustration, of course, and
such users would rarely attempt a daytime connection when the Internet itself
was lagged considerably.   Regardless, higher baud modems are inexpensive, and
organizations hoping to serve underserved communities should attempt to acquire
faster connections to assure that their participants can use the M* during a
wider expanse of time, whether from home or a public place.</p><p>
	The flipside of M*s' technical simplicity is their operational complexity.
Just as reading requires more developed skills than does television-watching,
highly-interactive M*ing requires more training than does passive Web-surfing
or even newsgroup reading.  Even the interfaces currently available to
'simplify' M* interaction do little to ease the necessity of learning a
specialized command language. As they stand, M* clients merely make it simpler
to view the M* screens and change a command before it is entered.  The client
interfaces themselves require some familiarization to operate effectively, and
some require simple coding to use fully. In the case of TinyFugue, one of the
most popular and powerful clients, help information is provided in the form of
a difficult on-line system rather than as an accessible external form such as
manual or a written tutorial.  </p><p>
	In fact, the scarcity of printed documentation in general has led to some of
the M*s' most persistent and potentially valuable aspects -- users are expected
to teach one another, and to come to know the space through interaction with
it. Many MOOs, for example, include programmed on-line tutorials, and MOOcode
itself supports a robust help system.  There is high toleration by longer-term
residents of  newbies' errors, and certain M*s provide 'helpful person'
information so that new users can easily locate the characters most willing to
answer questions. More recent features allow users to provide accessible
descriptions of their interests or research, but in many cases, it is still
another player (chosen at random) who will instruct a newbie in accessing this
more detailed information. </p><p>
 	While this <i>modus operandi </i>serves the constructivist purpose of the
most recent M*s, it is not yet clear how such a necessity for self-education
would impact social service M* users, who might have little time to spend
becoming acquainted with arcane commands.  It would make sense to provide
beginners' manuals for individuals accessing M*s when quicker proficiency has
notable value. But such a document is also in danger of changing the attitudes
of active users away from the traditional participatory responsibility for all
the members of the community, towards a more individualist 'learn it yourself,
like I did' mentality, a mindset which is in contrast to the communal potential
to which a service organization might be drawn in the first place.</p><p>
	According to one MOO wizard, MOO client interfaces offer the greatest
potential for easing textual interactions; powerful clients could smooth the
process of online interactions in more graphic and customizable ways, in a
manner comparable to the way that different Web clients interpret and present
information based on a standard, and indeed arcane, HTML document.  Client
interfaces will remove the burden of accessibility from the MOOcode itself;
externalization will allow for specialized interfaces such as speaking clients
for the blind, and graphic interfaces for young children (Kastner 1995). </p><p>
	One of the most obvious yet least explicated constraints of M* use is the
significant amount of <u>time</u> in front of a computer terminal required to
learn the medium and be able to take full advantage of its features.  The
learning curve for MOO interaction, along with the attraction of self-creation
and textual play, can severely limit the physical life of M* participants.  In
fact, the immersive qualities of M* interaction could hinder the purported
purpose of the organizations which utilize them, depending on the particular
use to which a M* is being put;  M* users could become so caught up in the
political and social relationships which develop on the M* that they spend less
time working to accomplish their ostensible goals.  Such social entanglements
can and usually do arise within any human group, regardless of the means
through which they interact.  But, for the time being at least, the same events
on the M* require that the physical bodies of the participants be situated at
keyboards, in front of screens.  </p><p>
	This placement is not usually amenable to providing a public service or acting
politically.  The students, academics, and researchers who developed M*
applications already spend significant and necessary time in front of computer
terminals, and often use higher-grade machines that allow for multi-tasking and
windowing.  Agencies which provide directly for human needs, however, can ill
afford to spare the time and energy which complete MOO utilization might
require of their employees, especially considering that individuals at many
such organizations will not be able to perform other computerized tasks while
using a donated machine to access the textual world. Clients of some
organizations should be better able to afford to spend time on-line,
particularly if they are actually recieving assistance through the MOO, such as
participating in group therapy or computer literacy training.</p><p>

[How] do changes in forms of communications technology affect the constructions
placed on experience? How does such technology change the forms of community in
which experience is apprehended and expressed?  What, under the force of
history, technology, and society, is thought about , thought with, and to whom
is it expressed?  ...Advances in our understanding of culture cannot be secured
unless they are tied to a vivid sense of technology and social structure.
(Carey 1988)</p><p>
</p><p>
	Given this elaboration of what a MOO is and can do, it becomes imperative to
explore whether this medium would be able to fulfill an unmet need in the
delivery of social services.  What would be the advantage for a not-for-profit
organization to involve its workers or its clientele in real-time textual
worlds?  To do so, it is necessary to look at some of the specific qualities of
MOO interaction as they have been observed over the relatively few years of the
medium's existence.  </p><p>
	The primary strength of real-time computer-mediated communications is to
facilitate empathetic relationships between remotely-located users.
Individuals in similar social situations yet geographically isolated from one
another have been using CMC forms like email lists and newsgroups to
communicate for almost a decade.  CMC is lauded for its ability to create a
'living database'  and a circle of emotional support simultaneously (Rheingold
1993).  Only recently have M*s been used for such explicit purposes;  because
of their characteristics, however, they are uniquely suited to perform this
communicative role.  MOOs are real-time, incorporating a sense of spatiality
and an attendant privacy, as such they are ideally suited to facilitate close
personal interactions between physically remote participants.  Concurrently,
the anonymity of M*s encourages lowered social inhibitions to some degree,
enabling users to divulge information about themselves that they might
otherwise be uncomfortable reporting.  Given this quality, MOOs are
particularly appropriate to distance counseling or therapy, and might be
appropriate for remotely situated 12-step participants or homebound senior
citizens. </p><p>
	This propensity for lowered inhibitions in M*s has its disadvantages, of
course.  M*s are by no means entirely secure, and examples abound of
individuals abusing their knowledge of system code to capture and distribute
personal and potentially humiliating information about other characters. In one
traumatic incident, involving what was perhaps the first example of M* use for
social services, JennyMUSH<a href="http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/%7Emoboid/border/socMOOs_fn.html#fn5">[6]</a>,  a M*
dedicated to the counseling and  rehabilitation of survivors of sexual trauma
was also the first social-service M* to be attacked and damaged by a hostile
outsider with technical savvy. An aberrant individual entered the JennyMUSH
system legitimately, as a participant, then used knowledge of the M's social
tools to become a character named "Daddy". Daddy then proceeded to "shout"
violent, abusive exhortations across the entire M*.  </p><p>
	The perpetrator was quickly confronted by a number of the system's
participants and later was expelled by the administrator of the system, but
some users were forced to log off to avoid once again the mental trauma which
they had joined this M* to escape.  In addition, the incident sparked the fears
of non-privacy within the community. What had been a completely anonymous haven
became in one sense a less safe space; among other changes, users were required
to give references and to provide real names and addresses in order to gain
access.  My point then is that, while MOOs tend to encourage social freedom of
a positive kind, in absence of fear of rejection, it also encourages emotional
behaviors of a different sort, in absence of constraints to prevent abuse. </p><p>
	Mediation plays a crucial role in these social technologies. Because M*s are
clearly not representing people unerringly as they "are", the textual worlds
encourage behavior contrary to that which builds trust.  MOO participants need
to be aware from the start that M* interactions combine extremes of suspicion
and trust.  How would a social-service-providing MOO increase the level of
respect given to every participant yet inform the 'innocent' that they may be
abused?  </p><p>
	MOOs are not just a tool for lessening of distances, they also create and
adjust notions of self-identity and humanity thanks to their masking qualities.
Users are given a far wider choice in self-representation in textual worlds
than the physical plane allows. How are those choices informed?  Will highly
mediated communications bring people out of identity-based distinctions, or
create even more sophisticated means of determining 'belongingness'? What
happens to services based on a recipient's ethnicity or gender when such
identities simply cannot be assessed?</p><p>
	Clearly, not every social goal is served equally by real-time, spatial,
semi-private ASCII-textual interaction across potentially vast distances.  As
good as M*s are at facilitating coordination, communication, serendipity and
empathy, they cannot do the bulk of a service which provides for basic needs.
For instance, workers in regionally localized movements such as homeless
advocacy, low-income housing or meals-on-wheels might benefit from the
information-sharing and moral support, yet need to spend significant amounts of
time meeting with locals face-to-face in order to raise funding and provide
their service.  And the needs of social service clients themselves can be best
met through MOOs if their needs are based in access to information,
conversation, education, and social support.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>conclusion</b></p><p>
<b></b></p><p>
<b></b>Given a network of [information] monopolies backed by corporate economic
and political power,  we reach a stage under the impulse of advanced
communication at which there is simultaneously advancing knowledge and
declining knowing.  We keep waiting to be informed, t o be educated, but lose
the capacity to produce knowledge for ourselves in decentralized communities of
understanding. (Carey 1988)</p><p>
<b></b></p><p>
<b></b>	If the media hype is to be believed, text-only Internet services are a
dying breed. In light of the wider availability and accessibility of graphics,
sound, and multimedia on the Internet, it might be presumed that networked
textual interactions will cease to be of relevance, and will soon be replaced.
However there are not yet any widespread, inexpensive, and robust visual or
audio network communications media which provide spatial metaphors and contain
the tools for users to control their own surroundings.  The textual worlds that
the Internet already allows will continue to be the most useful real-time
interaction tools, not only because they are the most widely available, but
because they will continue to be the least expensive and most easily customized
on-line places.</p><p>
	While remaining conscious and cautious, I believe that M*s provide a special
kind of interaction unavailable elsewhere from which certain varieties of
(underfunded) service organizations could benefit to degree disproportionate to
the low cost of participating. While I realize the inability of MOO and Unix
code to serve every disadvantaged individual, I see potential for the presence
of real-time textual worlds to assist the purposes of social service
organizations. The grassroots, home built nature of both Unix and MOOcode leave
space for wider, more diverse participation in the virtual community even while
the culturally specific origins of the two media suggest otherwise.  ASCII,
Unix, and MOOcode are not digital blank slates, but their particular
characteristics can provide foundational material for organized social change
to be enacted by individuals separated by great distances.  Most importantly,
the real-time virtual presence of physically distant human beings, which only
M*s can easily and convincingly provide, can create impetus for oppositional
methodologies of on-line activity to develop and come to fruition.  Only
through direct and multiple person-to-person interactions can the dominant
culture's unidirectional ideal of 'information' be abandoned for the
challenging but far more equitable "decentralized community of
understanding."</p><p>
